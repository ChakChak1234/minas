16:31 Anonymous so far: What do y&aposall think about SQ tomorrow? Down?
16:31 VolCrush: *histograms
16:31 JC_chart: i do actually sometimes but not in that image
16:31 VolCrush: i tink SQ has lost all or most of their top shelf managers, apparently der CEO is an arse
16:32 JC_chart: in that image I am showing two different histograms one driven on breadth and volume and one driven on price
16:32 VolCrush: wats the delta rthen from one histo to the other?
16:32 VolCrush: ah ok
16:32 JC_chart: the move
16:32 JC_chart: or momentum
16:33 JC_chart: but here let me do a fib one so you dont think i am bsing you one sec
16:33 VolCrush: momentum in volume? volume and breadth?
16:33 VolCrush: btw, you should be able to post the chart directly in here 
16:33 JC_chart: yes as a raw input that is transformed by the indicator
16:38 JC_chart: this is one of the GC trades i did
16:38 JC_chart: i tried to post it right in here but gave me a bad size
16:39 JC_chart: the entry was at one fib and exit at another
16:39 VolCrush: got it, thanks
16:40 JC_chart: my sq chart says it is flat lined in a range so hard to tell what will happen tomorrow
16:40 admin_tculs: JC  please do not post outside links here
16:41 JC_chart: well how do you post an image in her admin_TCULS
16:41 VolCrush: s/he is tryin to post the TOS chart in here, but I and others don't know how to do that
16:44 AlphaInvestor: JC - make your chart smaller before clippping - I use WinDoze 10 Snipping Tool. Then past into the chat box, right click and Zoom to 10%. Then hit send
16:45 VolCrush: ty, Alpha
16:45 JC_chart: how small
16:45 VolCrush: 10%
16:45 Gus: can't wait until eveything can be shorted with ease
16:46 AlphaInvestor: 640 x 640 I believe, but not sure
16:46 VolCrush: LOL, shorting for the last 3 days has been as easy as it gets
16:47 Gus: anybody a strictly short saler here?
16:47 VolCrush: or what, Alpha said
16:47 JC_chart: k
16:48 Gus: also yeah, but the consistency of being able to short all the time so not just 3 days lol
16:48 JC_chart: been able to short gold for a long time LOL
16:49 Gus: yes yes for sure but easier lol, i guess I'm not on the JC_chart level yet haha
16:49 AlphaInvestor: Gus - you can short most liquid things, those that are NTB or HTB, you can often go Synthetic Short via options
16:50 AlphaInvestor: Sell an ATM call, buy an ATM put - viola ... you are synthetic short stock
16:50 Gus: only have 18k and ive shorted $SUPV $MDXG $INNT & $BFR easy plays but as i get better I don't want to implode from lok
16:50 AlphaInvestor: I have a couple Call Credit Spreads on BFR -- bearish play
16:51 Gus: yeah i got out of it awhile back but thinking of heading back in soon
16:51 VolCrush: i tink he a penny scalper
16:52 Gus: not all the time haha but percentages are huge on plays like that
16:52 Gus: bfr went down like 15% in the last week, i shorted $SUPV instead and got 7% before it reversed and now its down another 7% since i left
16:53 AlphaInvestor: Vol - ah, CCS too commish intensive for penny scalping
16:53 AlphaInvestor: SUPV doesn't trade options, I cannot be short in my IRA
16:53 Gus: h&s pattern with a terrible downtrend on those stocks is a consistent play that I've made but don't wait long enough to realize
16:53 Gus: the best gainz
16:54 Gus: also, laugh if you'd like, ive never touched options haha
16:55 Gus: just basic shorting and longing, mostly shorting, as im better at that.
16:58 JC_chart: wow TOS sure does make it hard for you
16:58 VolCrush: chit bronx, AH moves e.g. AMZN*
16:59 JC_chart:  
16:59 JC_chart: OMG did that work
16:59 JC_chart: so vol that was an NVDA trade i took
17:00 JC_chart: entered when histos and trend line were green at the bottom of the range fib and exited at the 23.6
17:01 VolCrush: DAMN u did it, way to persevere
17:01 JC_chart: i am not sure if that was more frustrating or when the time and sales stopped today on gc LOL
17:07 AlphaInvestor: you missed the part about right clicking and scaling down to 10%
17:08 AlphaInvestor: That way you can post a slightly bigger chart, scaled down so it doesn't burn so much buffer
17:08 RandomDan: I am back.
17:09 AlphaInvestor: whew
17:10 RandomDan: I see I shouldn't have sold BABA
17:11 408Spartan: Any idea how to enable After Hours/ Pre Market prices for the tickers in MarketWatch?
17:12 JC_chart: I am not sure how to scale it down on my mac actually

17:28 chenmannmobile: yes bt
17:29 chenmannmobile: if good , up we go
17:30 AlphaInvestor: BT - yes, I posted the banks that are reporting earlier
17:30 chenmannmobile: nflx er 16th al
17:31 NullTrader: Hi I have a study that was created by my own code. I was able to edit it before. Now when I right click it, it only shows a "calculator" but no code to edit. What did I do wrong?

17:31 blondetrader: well fingers crossed
17:31 blondetrader: from these prices the long would be so much more awesome
17:34 408Spartan: JC_chart can you post a s creenshot of what youre seeing? I couldnt find it.
17:36 JC_chart: what im seeing  for what?
17:36 408Spartan: the Setting youre talking bout
17:36 VolCrush: meh, meh
17:37 RandomDan: gap up tomorrow becoming more plausible
17:37 chenmannmobile: buy baba back dan
17:37 chenmannmobile: ah
17:37 408Spartan: Apparently you cant or so says Support "Hello! Sorry about the wait. Afterhours prices you will look at the bid and ask."
17:38 VolCrush: pics from bronx, becoming a 98% probibility with IV of 2%
17:38 AlphaInvestor: 408 - wrong!!
17:38 AlphaInvestor: But support don't know diddly some times
17:38 JC_chart: im short gc at 1227
17:38 amalia: Buy /YM
17:38 RandomDan: too late, sold at 141.90
17:39 RandomDan: I am not buying back at a loss
17:39 JC_chart: target is 1226. but might not get there on 1st try
17:39 408Spartan: AlphaInvestor thats what I thought i mean its a pretty simple utility just goddamn hard to find tht Setting
17:39 AlphaInvestor: 408 - add a new custom column - I named mine myLast ... put a single word inside    CLOSE   ... set the aggregation to 1 minute using the little box that defaults to D (daily)
17:39 RandomDan: I am long plenty of other stuff
17:40 amalia: 61 t trail
17:41 blondetrader: gc drop to 20
17:41 JC_chart: 404spart do you see the gear in your tooldbar header a
17:41 JC_chart: haha
17:41 AlphaInvestor:  
17:41 JC_chart: im hoping that for you with rty
17:41 blondetrader: and tomorrow if below that 1213
17:41 RandomDan: JC I think you will make money short gc
17:41 AlphaInvestor: 408 - also, make sure you click the box for EXT hours
17:42 AlphaInvestor: right click that post, zoom up to 100%
17:42 blondetrader: will prob do gc short tomorrow
17:42 amalia: P shape from 24,893
17:42 amalia: Intraday
17:43 VolCrush: i noticed the move in /gc today, kinda scratched myself but the $$$$ did dip a bit; inflation worries all over
17:43 JC_chart: I dont know  gc hit 126.6 5 times now  and my chart is now  has conflict
17:43 VolCrush: listening to the Grateful Dead eating pistachio ice cream
who, who has it better than us?
17:44 AlphaInvestor: NOBODY
17:44 JC_chart: i think it was the shorts covering after  the hbid up last night and early this morning and some hedging too
17:45 RandomDan: gc was just a fear play IMHO, fear be dissipating. It's not a good inflation hedge even if inflation actually became a thingm
17:45 AlphaInvestor: Timberland is a great inflation hedge! And I know just the guy ...
17:45 JC_chart: dont disagree but the market players become irrational on days like to day so....
17:46 RandomDan: yeah but if the market rises tomorrow, gc goes back to sleep
17:47 JC_chart: ya know GC has always a few great day trades every day
17:47 RandomDan: I don't really follow it. It's just on my watchlist for context.
17:48 JC_chart: and if youre right, it will march back to 1165 or so and that could be a good bit of trading to there
17:48 JC_chart: i like trading cl too but sometimes it is just too   whiphot and wicky candles so i trade gc
17:49 AlphaInvestor: Well, it was real today. Later Traders
17:49 JC_chart: I dont like es as i it is expensive and actually doesnt have that many great moves except when a plunge happens
17:49 RandomDan: No idea. I think it's going to hang around 1200, but no reasoning behind that.
17:49 chenmannmobile: later al
17:49 RandomDan: later Al
17:49 VolCrush: /cl is the most news driven product out there, to trade /cl you must follow the news on /cl and global macros
17:50 RandomDan: the mood in the room is different tonight. yesterday most of us were shell shocked
17:50 JC_chart: I just follow my chart for cl
17:50 JC_chart: when things agree and there is a fib range go in
17:50 JC_chart: there are usually 10 or so trades a day on the 3m
17:51 RandomDan: cl... I have no edge at all. Would never try it.
17:51 JC_chart: my charts have the edge
17:51 RandomDan: I don't know how many tankers are parked wherever... how many rigs this and that.
17:52 JC_chart: don't really give a you know what ... my chart indicators agree there i is a trade i take it as i beleive in my charts
17:53 JC_chart: not saying that with any obnoxiousness just saying that is the truth
17:53 chenmannmobile: i only trade cl during war
17:53 chenmannmobile: any war
17:53 RandomDan: Whatever works for you man.
17:53 JC_chart: i lost a lot of money  disagreeing with my chart and not beleiveing in my system ... once i paid attention and trusted my system its been great
17:53 RandomDan: war, charts, loaded dice
17:55 chenmannmobile: cnbc special, was today s flush the bottom?
17:55 RandomDan: 
17:56 blondetrader: ugh
17:57 RandomDan: my sense, and take it for what its worth, is tomorrow is big bounce #1, but I have no idea if it will hold (or even happen, just the voice in my head)
17:58 chenmannmobile: did fill that gap es 2713, and bounced right off
17:58 RandomDan: Also, while I am playing a clairvoyant trader on TV, I would look for GOOG close to 1120
17:59 RandomDan: 1115 maybe. Something like that.
18:00 VolCrush: welp, if CNBS said that, we have 500 points more to the downside   
18:00 RandomDan: Of course ERs could be awful and the whole house of cards goes to the floor.
18:00 VolCrush: or short the gap up, LOL
18:00 RandomDan: What are those fine folks saying?
18:01 VolCrush: or read the *ucking tape
18:01 chenmannmobile: "it s time to nibble" cramer
18:01 VolCrush: i would never much less take a bite out of Cramer
18:01 VolCrush: *I would never nibble...
18:01 RandomDan: Cramer would be good if he didn't push his book so much.
18:01 VolCrush: really is he tasty
18:02 VolCrush: ??
18:02 RandomDan: I like the guy. It's like having an uncle who's a used car salesman.
18:03 VolCrush: you shouldn't refer to Marcos that way
18:04 RandomDan: I wouldn't buy a car from him but I like the stories.
18:05 chenmannmobile: o wow futures up lot....so far

18:32 amalia: Hoping polarity stays positive
18:32 tmoney20g: so that's almost 100 pts since 3pm
18:36 amalia: Yep. #TeamWideStops ftw
18:36 amalia: And for the losses. haha
18:40 EasyE: I just need SPY to open at 288 and I'll be done.

06:47 Deep: Big dips always comes in threes. Get ready
06:49 Eedie: My numbers are way off on GC.  I show 19-21 as support and 27 as target higher.  So I'm staying away because I'm way off target compared to your numbers..
06:50 Eedie: I think I'm staying with es and rty.
06:50 Eedie: However, silver looks interesting.
06:51 blondetrader: ohhh I havent looked at that in a long while

07:53 Vimes: not a tax guy, but i would guess at your nomral tax rate
07:53 blondetrader: you can prob goog it
07:53 Regretfulflyer: I’ve tried it’s not Exactly easy to understand
07:54 blondetrader: hold on
07:54 blondetrader: it is 50% of the gain at your current tax rate
07:55 Regretfulflyer: Thanks
07:55 blondetrader: ur welcome wow canada actually lower cap gain overall that us 
07:55 blondetrader: thats the only rate lower but nice'
07:55 AlphaInvestor: I get taxes withheld on lots of ADRs from lots of countries. I don't keep track, it's a cost of doin' biz
07:56 Regretfulflyer: So 50% of my dividends are withheld so I can tell the IRS to give me more because I took a loss
07:56 tmoney20g: hi hi
07:57 streetglide: O Canada......our home and native land
07:57 Regretfulflyer: Can we buy into the ASX, and the British stock market?
07:57 blondetrader: your taxed on 50% of the gain
07:57 Regretfulflyer: Gain is dividends yes?
07:58 blondetrader: yes if the div was 100 you r taxed on 50.00
07:58 blondetrader: not sure about how much loss can be offset
07:58 Regretfulflyer: Talk about a kick below the belt in taxes ouch
07:58 blondetrader: but i think it would wash
07:59 blondetrader: well we r taxed on 100% of our gains so
07:59 Regretfulflyer: Does the UK and AUS have banks on the NYSE that offer dividends?
08:00 blondetrader: that I do not know
08:00 tmoney20g: someone's gotta pay for all that maple syrup
08:00 tmoney20g: esmal, whatcha eyeing ?
08:00 Eedie: LOL tmoney
08:01 tmoney20g: o yay, it worked.
08:01 tmoney20g: i have trailstop for options
08:01 Regretfulflyer: Someone talked to us at the local 145 plumbers union about stocks this year I’m the only one who made a portfolio and self managing it. Were told diversify in other countries but safely in banks
08:01 dug03: @Regret... don't forget USA gives a foreign tax credit amongst all that mess, I never paid attention,, neither urgent nor important to figure out
08:02 Eedie: Ok  anybody have BABA?
08:02 streetglide: Good for you Regret...good luck with it
08:02 dug03: I know it cost me more tx with SAN, than it did with ITUB
08:03 blondetrader: I do
08:03 blondetrader: pcs
08:03 Regretfulflyer: Why I’m trying to figure out how to buy into the UK and AUS and CAN
08:03 tmoney20g: buy a house in each country
08:03 tmoney20g: then you'll live everywhere
08:03 Regretfulflyer: ....that’s more money than I have atm
08:03 tmoney20g: oh
08:04 tmoney20g: i feel your pain
08:04 Regretfulflyer: Think my total invested in is $2k
08:04 john: Good morning all! Woke up with MU going up?
08:04 tmoney20g: i have 3 houses in 1 place
08:04 tmoney20g: instead of 1 house in 3 places
08:04 lilFish: does anyone know the trick to making earningscast play?
08:04 Regretfulflyer: Can I has a house?
08:05 AlphaInvestor: Tmoney - if you are using a Stop with options, then you don't understand options
08:05 blondetrader: omg ya dont do that
08:05 Regretfulflyer: ??
08:06 john: Alph- you said the stock I bot with my strategy was bad. But I made 400$
08:07 Eedie: Wtg on BABA BT
08:07 Regretfulflyer: I don’t day trade it’s like Russian roulette too risky
08:08 Regretfulflyer: Plus warren buffet says the $$$ is in long holding for dividends so did JP Morgan
08:09 Regretfulflyer: Does anyone know a better REIT than O, or STAG?
08:09 john: Yeah, I am starting to notice the long hold is better
08:11 Regretfulflyer: Only profitable REIT I found in Canada is SHAW but is there any under 5% yield but pays well?
08:11 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Casino almost open!
08:11 Regretfulflyer: Profitable
08:12 tmoney20g: paddle wheel casino ?
08:12 tmoney20g: are you in the ozarks ?
08:13 Regretfulflyer: Colorado
08:13 streetglide: Ozark is a good show
08:13 lilFish: hi street - love Ozark
08:13 streetglide: hey
08:14 Regretfulflyer: What is Ozark?
08:14 lilFish: show on netflix
08:14 Paul: If a company buys back half it's stock, does the obligation to the dividend remain the same on the repurchased shares?
08:14 Regretfulflyer: Ah, then no I can’t afford Netflix I’m buying stocks instead
08:15 streetglide: a company is not going to pay itself on those repurchased shares
08:16 streetglide: everyone else still gets their same divy
08:16 Paul: so that would mean it's retained earnings
08:16 Paul: would rise.
08:16 Regretfulflyer: Is there a REIT in the UK that’s on the NYSE? Under 5% yield but profitable?
08:17 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I think Paul is asking if the rermaining shares are required to be paid a dividend.  The answer is yes, but the board makes those declarations and can change it.
08:18 Paul: Excellent.
08:20 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Dividends are great, but I would not hold a stock in a downtrend just to get the dividend.  That's just me.
08:20 Regretfulflyer: Buffet does and selling in a down trend you’re throwing money down the toilet
08:21 streetglide: actually dividends reduce retained earnings, btw
08:21 lilFish: so noone here listens to conference calls on earningscast?
08:22 Regretfulflyer: No WiFi at my apartment only cell phone so nope
08:23 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I can't argue with what you said, Regret, that is what Buffet does.   But like I said, it's just me.  I like to buy stocks into momentum,  not bottom fish....most of the time anyway.
08:23 streetglide: you can probably go to JPM site and get a recording, fish
08:24 lilFish: yea - i was hoping this would be one convenient place to listen to all of them and not have to give my email to every corporate site I'm interested in listening to
08:24 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Lil, not me.  The Big Fish pay big money to get that info about 15 seconds before the little fish, so it's already moving before we get the info.  
08:24 G3_: you can go to the company website, get the phone # five mins beffore conference call begins.  As a last resort 
08:24 G3_: beat me to it Street
08:24 Regretfulflyer: I’m trying to find banks and reits in the UK that offer dividends. Google says 15m searches found. The pages don’t offer information
08:25 lilFish: thx -that sounds like a good option
08:25 fred__w: important gap shows in an app i have  suggesting a halfway pt
08:26 fred__w: but  as always  play the tape
08:26 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: they pay millions to get that info before everyone else.  
08:26 Regretfulflyer: Why do y’all want to listen to a boring conference call
08:26 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: amazon has rebounded 80 bucks
08:27 tmoney20g: @esmal what you gonna do
08:27 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: scuse me 75
08:27 Regretfulflyer: And it cost $2k to buy nope
08:27 Regretfulflyer: I’d rather buy LMT cheaper and more dividends
08:28 Regretfulflyer: Dividend
08:29 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: LMT earnings on 10/23
08:30 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: may have a lot of stocks bounce off their 200 day averages today
08:31 Regretfulflyer: Question? Does France have banks listed on the nyse?
08:32 thetiderider777: chart lags badly again today
08:33 Regretfulflyer: I’m hungry I’m going to eat breakfast nice talking to y’all ^_~>
08:34 unasol: has anyone found a better alternative to TOS, with decent indicators?
08:34 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: SQ had dropped over 30% from its high, and still has not touched its 200 day
08:35 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: after a gap up now they'er selling SQ
08:35 fred__w: ibelieve i dodged a bullet with this open  now at even strength
08:36 radon224: nasty chart lag, again
08:37 JC_chart: GM
08:37 fred__w: radon  i suggest learning to trade with prices extant  do the chart stuff prior  just a suggestion
08:37 RandomFamily: good morning
08:37 JC_chart: BT if you are still in RTY i am impressed on your ability to weather a ride
08:37 JC_chart: but it is paying short now
08:38 radon224: I use "something else" to get my quotes fred
08:38 JC_chart: GC cant decide what it wants to do alot of conflict on my chart
08:38 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: CNBC sure is trying to talk up the markets.  "Russell 2000 has now exited it's correction".
08:38 JC_chart: im long 221 aapl calls
08:39 ranchman: team
08:39 fred__w: rad  nice
08:39 fred__w: darryl  there can be another test
08:40 ranchman: team  I have $2500 in my "cash & sweep vehicle" but is not in my  "option buying power fund".  Why?  I deposited two days ago?  help...
08:40 michael9844: whats going on with TOS and lagging charts
08:41 michael9844: Pretty sad for such a large and well known platform
08:41 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Anybody else spot the Qs selling at the open even though it gapped?  Looked like pretty good downside volume
08:41 fred__w: ranch  you have to play with that  its not obvious  at least it wasnt for me  how to tell if cash is settled
08:42 fred__w: ..there is a way tho
08:42 fred__w: ..cash avail for withdrawal is key
08:42 fred__w: imo
08:42 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Td settles way faster than Scottrade did that's for sure.
08:43 ranchman: so I guess it takes more than two days?
08:44 tmoney20g: over night for options, could be T+2 for equities
08:44 tmoney20g: the trade desk would know better answers
08:44 4205: Not the only one who has a lagging chart, right?
08:44 Chappy: Good day all. Is anyone else getting massive chart lag?
08:45 tmoney20g: yes, everyone will have it at the open, too much traffic
08:45 Anonymous so far: yep second day this has happened
08:45 4205: Yup. Thats unfortunate
08:45 pietro: Why is the chart lagging?
08:45 michael9259: yes. second day for me
08:45 Chappy: crappers
08:45 michael9259: prophet is working correctly it seems but....
08:46 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: opinions on GDX?  Looks like breakout yesterday, pulling back today.  I've been burned on this one before!
08:46 fred__w: daryl  yes  a day   it seems
08:47 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Chart lag is bc everything you think is happening today actually happened yesterday ;)
08:47 fred__w: unless we test lows  im done for the day  i think
08:48 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Already fred?  You cashed in some calls?
08:49 fred__w: darryl  i went long prematurely  and balanced at the open  gratefully  the mkt gapped up
08:50 michael0093: in a surprising twist... my tos is running fine... unlike yestrerday, active trader not synched with charts or level 2.  try unplugging the modem for a minute.
08:50 JC_chart: out of aapl long, waiting for /GC to get out of its range... I would wait on GDX too it is in a stair step down move but gold hasnt made up its mind yet today, my charts look more choppy than anything else on gold
08:50 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: k, thanks GC
08:50 fred__w: darryl  i accomplished my goal tho
08:50 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: cool
08:51 fred__w: ..and thx to the gap up  with minimal damage
08:51 AlphaInvestor: Til Ray
08:52 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: yeah, GDX is pulling back from overbought yesterday outside BB's
08:52 Dimka: Jeez, everything green except my holdings
08:52 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I know the feeling dimka!   
08:53 AlphaInvestor: DING - closed HPQ short call for a penny
08:53 fred__w: darryl  in position trading  relative long short holdings is key
08:54 featherweight: I believe I can fly
08:55 featherweight: I believe I can touch the sky
08:55 featherweight: I think about spooz every night and day
08:55 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I'm the boy plunger  :)
08:56 JC_chart: market makers just got sick of waiting on gold and threw a big whack of cash to push it down lets see if it will stay and if it does gdx will follow
08:56 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: That refers to Jesse Livermore btw  :)
08:56 tmoney20g: just tested the TRAILSTOPLIMT
08:56 Thlinx: I still see the QQQ going lower
08:56 fred__w: darryl  yes  i know
08:56 tmoney20g: it worked, but i had it set too narrow of a trail
08:57 tmoney20g: gonna be a learning curve here
08:57 Bealzybub: ACRX trading halted ahead of FDA meeting..........
08:58 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Once bitten, twice shy on miners.  Actually more than once bitten.
08:59 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Miners are literally near the bottom 5 of 200 sectors in Investors Business daily.  
09:00 JC_chart: I dont disagree but there are many great day trades in miners and gold futures with the right setups
09:00 streetglide: I cant ever seem to time the miners etf's worth a chit
09:00 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: might've went up a little yesterday.  Have not checked.
09:00 JC_chart: just day trades
09:01 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Me neither Street, but I think that's bc they have been on a downtrend, so rebound breakouts get hammered
09:02 streetglide: a lot tof times they dont follow gc all that well intraday
09:02 JC_chart: the gold futures actually are better to trade
09:02 blondetrader: am short gc
09:02 blondetrader: 23.5
09:02 JC_chart: hard to make money on options with gdx
09:02 JC_chart: yep im short from 1224.7
09:03 JC_chart: crossed  the midpoint target is 1222.8
09:04 JC_chart: and im out at 1222.7
09:04 JC_chart: so u never coulda got that move with options on gdx ,, but u can with futures
09:06 streetglide: gc is sort of like cl...you get these rips and wooshes for no apparent reason at times
09:07 AlphaInvestor: Street - it isn't "no apparent reason" it is geopolitics
09:07 JC_chart: its traders they drive the swooshes and that volatility is where the money is
09:07 streetglide: works both ways JC
09:08 JC_chart: yeah but the chart shows the moves so the setups are pretty clear
09:08 streetglide: intraday Al in a 5 min time frame isnt geo
09:08 JC_chart: for example look at the nounce in GC right now you could see that bounce coming back to the midpoint and continue down by seeing the momentum
09:10 AlphaInvestor: Street - okay, you are right at 1-min and 5-min ... prices are RANDOM
09:11 AlphaInvestor: sometimes we randomly get multpile bars in a row in the same direction
09:11 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I don't trade options, just buy or sell short
09:11 JC_chart: sorry guys beg to differ on the whooshes
09:11 JC_chart: they are pure market manipulation on GC and cl
09:11 fred__w: alpha  fractal  you mean  :)
09:12 streetglide: agree JC
09:12 AlphaInvestor: Fred - no, I mean Random at those timeframes
09:12 fred__w: ..tho i dont use 1min
09:12 AlphaInvestor: Fred - but yes, prices are fractal in nature
09:12 JC_chart: its spoofing and its knowing ahead of time who needs to hedge and trading that news
09:13 JC_chart: and it is programmed algorithims that move from fib line to fib line during the day
09:13 AlphaInvestor: is JC off his meds again   ;-)
09:13 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: My personal opinion is, I receive better candle signals on 5 minute charts
09:13 blondetrader: haha he is correct
09:13 streetglide: exactly
09:13 fred__w: ..bcuz  they arent  as you suggest  as useful for trading decisions
09:14 JC_chart: i like the 3m on oil and gold
09:14 streetglide: there is a reason you dont trade them Al
09:14 fred__w: ..i do you 5 with 15 to get context
09:14 fred__w: use*
09:15 chenmann: jpm red
09:15 chenmann: careful
09:15 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: does anybody besides me think that ebay could plunge on earnings coming up?  I dunno, but chart looks WEAK
09:15 AlphaInvestor: order in to close TLRY long call at intrinsic that matches today's intraday high
09:16 AlphaInvestor: Darryl - EBAY complaining that AMZN stealing customers ... not a good sign
09:16 esmal:   morninig all
09:16 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: morning
09:17 chenmann: out spy
09:17 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I could see ebay plunging to a 26 handle
09:18 esmal: @tmoney, no clue yet
09:19 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I hate trading on earnings though, unless wer
09:19 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: shoot....unless we're in a clear bear market.
09:20 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: shorting that is.
09:20 tmoney20g: esmal
09:20 tmoney20g: i have trailstops now
09:20 michael9259: charts are fine now but, man, i can't trade here if this thing can't handle the US open! developers need to put in some overtime this weekend.
09:21 Tanya: GM, holly wow, been busy not dare checking portfolio
09:21 streetglide: hated seeing the overnight rampage....not good to buy the gap ups and hard to short cause it could have gapped and go'd......is go'd a word?
09:21 JC_chart: /ES banging on the bottom of its range here, chart says we go down
09:21 Tanya: Are you all scared yet?
09:21 JC_chart: to 2775 i bet
09:21 JC_chart: which is midpoint
09:22 esmal: good to hear!
09:23 tmoney20g: i tried 2 trailstoplimit, but got stopped out early
09:23 tmoney20g: gotta figure this out
09:23 tmoney20g: think i'll just try trailstop 
09:24 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Tanya, me don't trust this bounce at all.  MHO.
09:25 AlphaInvestor: Tmoney - what multiple of ATR are yoiu setting yoiur trail stop to ?   Hint, Hint
09:25 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: there is a lot of indecision after the gap
09:25 JC_chart: 2755 sorry for mistake
09:26 chenmann: out intc
09:26 tmoney20g: multiple ?
09:27 VET tryng to make money: What just happened
09:27 tmoney20g: i went potty
09:27 VET tryng to make money: So did the market
09:28 Tanya: Darryl, I am stuck here and waiting for correction to pass
09:28 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: If I could count on the Qs trading in a $1 range all day, I think I could make money.
09:28 VET tryng to make money: This market finishes in the red tonight .
09:29 StrikeOne: My stock scanner is incredibly slow today. Anyone else?
09:29 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: It could finish WAY in the red.
09:29 StrikeOne: Yesterday charts and scanner were useless to me.
09:29 tajtx: What makes you think so VET?
09:30 tmoney20g: esmal, on the website tho, doesn't show my filled sold orders
09:30 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: what's a stock scanner?  chart?
09:30 tmoney20g: only the buys
09:30 tmoney20g: any idea why that is ?
09:30 VET tryng to make money: We are not out of it and I think people will wait until Monday
09:30 tmoney20g: or anyone else using stops
09:30 VET tryng to make money: Instead of holding o Er the weekend
09:30 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I haven't traded anything
09:30 VET tryng to make money: Too many headlines
09:30 tajtx: OK thanks.     
09:30 esmal: i dont have the answer for that but I think when you enable advanced features it states that on the page
09:31 AlphaInvestor: Tmoney - you EXPECT the price to move by the ATR, so setting the trailing stop to less than the ATR almost guarantees yoiu will be stopped out
09:32 VET tryng to make money: Still tempted to by Starbucks
09:32 loneoak: Any thoughts on JetBlue?
09:33 nic007: Hi all- anyone use any subcription services they Recommend?? Raging Bull came across my desk--
09:33 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Vet, funny you mention SBUX.  I am thinking about shorting it, but want to see more weakness, but might not get it.
09:33 VET tryng to make money: Investitute
09:33 AlphaInvestor: Nic - you need to learn to make your own decisions.
09:33 VET tryng to make money: I’m in for the long I’ll sell against it
09:33 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: In fact, I have it on my screen right now.
09:34 VET tryng to make money: It’s up a bit that’s why I’m not in it now
09:34 nic007: Thanks Alpha. Yes, I agree.
09:34 AlphaInvestor: Nic - think about it, if they were good at trading ... they would be trading, not selling magic eleixir
09:34 esmal: lol
09:35 nic007: But as a newer trader, I paid for some mentorship that HAS helped, but most of those "alert subscriptions"  (couple I tried) were not helpful to me.
09:35 esmal: what did you exactly learn from your mentorship?
09:36 AlphaInvestor: Nic - attend Swim Lessons, taught free by TOS every day the market is open. Free eduction, free mentorship in the chat by SLS
09:36 Vimes: if you are an investor, go to hulbert digest and they rank some of the subscription services, for day trading i wouldn't trust any of the youtube junk
09:36 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: SBUX:  Ackman said he was buying it over the last 3 months, but then all of a sudden he wants the world to know he's done that.  So is he trying to dump his shares now into his advertisement?   15 million shares.   Either that or he is trying to talk up the price.
09:37 nic007: Alpha- ok thanks for that.
09:37 Kev : Sorry I am new to the TOS and trying to put in a trade. I kept getting ‘Illegal -1 Shares’. Can someone explain what that means?
09:37 JC_chart: I think tos lessons are great on their tools, but their mentorship is teaching you to take things like MACD crosses and well... iI have not seen that as a consistently winning strategy so i  was not impressed with their mentorship
09:38 Vimes: Kev, call the trade desk, either not appropriate margin approval, or funds available
09:38 Kev : Ok thanks @Vimes
09:38 tmoney20g: 3 for 3 today, feels nice
09:38 admin_tculs: Kev   call trade desk      800-672-2098� 
09:39 tmoney20g: esmal just filled trailstop
09:39 tmoney20g: i like that
09:39 JC_chart: nice .. happy friday
09:39 esmal: in the green>
09:39 esmal: ?*
09:40 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Qs trading in a $1 range.....still
09:40 JC_chart: im short GC since 1223.3
09:40 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: $1.30 actually
09:40 AlphaInvestor: Dayrrl - large investors like Ackman must disclose their positions quarterly
09:40 kaotekmonk: anyone in RGSE? your thoughts for the weekend?
09:41 JC_chart: taregt is 1221 but may not be strong enough to get their
09:41 tmoney20g: esmal yes
09:41 tmoney20g: just trading 1 contract
09:41 esmal: nice
09:41 tmoney20g: get to learn this
09:41 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: True Alpha, forgot about that
09:42 AlphaInvestor: Monk - nobody in here trades worthless penny stocks
09:42 AlphaInvestor: Ackman is not above the idea of "talking his book" tho
09:42 JC_chart: the range on the rgse is  0.10 and it is in a flatlined trend, i think there are other places you can make money with less risk if you want to hold over the weekend
09:43 JC_chart: im out of gc at 1221
09:44 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Ackman:  but if a big player wants to unload 15 million shares at a resistance level, he has to get players in to buy so the price doesn't plunge.
09:44 kaotekmonk: worthless? wow. must be in the wrong chatroom then.
09:44 AlphaInvestor: yup
09:45 chenmann: think tlry wants 155 al
09:45 AlphaInvestor: I will be out long before 155, option expires today
09:45 kaotekmonk: thanks jc_chart at least someone here has a career for advice.
09:45 radon224: AI used to say that about pot stocks, but something happened
09:46 chenmann: o i c
09:46 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: all I can tell you, is that when I look at a chart of SBUX i see a huge plunge in june, and a rocket back to the top.   That is not a good omen for a breakout to the upside.
09:46 chenmann: may get close today .... tlry
09:46 AlphaInvestor: DING - TLRY long call closed
09:47 AlphaInvestor: now I am only left with Bearish TLRY stuff - I feel much better
09:47 chenmann: haha nice trade .... even tho it was an accident
09:48 AlphaInvestor: made thousands on that accident
09:48 Vimes: a happy accident
09:48 AlphaInvestor: it was a 105 call, do the math
09:48 streetglide: happy endings are good
09:49 Vimes: but you were short stock, did you buy back on the open?
09:49 chenmann: i d close that bearish tlry stuff too ....al
09:49 AlphaInvestor: I bot back days ago
09:49 Vimes: oic, nice job
09:50 AlphaInvestor: I bot back thousands ago

09:51 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: SBUX:  I just drew a trendline from the peak in June 2017 to recent, downsloping,  price broke out on ackman announcement and then reversed below it again.  It could try another breakout, dunno.
09:51 AlphaInvestor: Chen - GTC order in to close at > 75% profit
09:51 chenmann: ha nice
09:51 chenmann: gl
09:52 AlphaInvestor: SBUIX was trying a Cup&Handle - but der market broke the handle
09:52 chenmann: chit, spike, looks like i closed my longs too early
09:52 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: True.
09:52 chenmann: tlry hod
09:53 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: What I am saying with SBUX is, I am in wait and see mode.  no action.
09:54 WYCOWBOY: Vimes, I am also.  Where does this $ come from?
09:54 fred__w: time for coffee
09:57 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: money comes from the fed, on their computer :)
09:58 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I'm already wired.  Woke up early.
09:59 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: man, these Qs are stuck in a range.  Interesting to see if which way they break
10:01 marc: anyone know how to add VIX to plot on chart you're working with
10:01 fred__w: darryl  i think probability favors south  but we'll see
10:01 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: my weekly trendline on SBUX crosses over to about 57.70.  That is the price I'm watching for.
10:02 Mhawk: Anyone had any experience with Charlottes Web? I hear it hit the OTC market yesterday?
10:02 marc: pot legal oct 17
10:03 Gmoney: What’s good today ?

10:04 marc: nov 2 amrn straddles
10:05 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: here Qs go down again in range....geez
10:06 DrHouse: Morning traders
10:08 Momoney: Exciting times ahead for acbff-can you say make me a millionaire!!
10:08 tmoney20g: calm down
10:09 tmoney20g: are you familiar with what happened in oregon ?
10:09 RandomDan: good morning
10:09 RandomDan: bt around?
10:10 blondetrader: yep
10:10 blondetrader: gm Dan
10:11 AlphaInvestor: berging all der potsters
10:12 RandomDan: hey bt, Al
10:12 RandomDan: what did /es print at the open?
10:12 RandomDan: I missed it.
10:12 tmoney20g: esmal, what would you set for a p1775 ?
10:13 tmoney20g: say you bought at 5.00 and wanted to take it to at least 7.00 ?
10:13 blondetrader: I wanna say 78
10:13 esmal: i cant say, amazon is trading sideways atm
10:14 tmoney20g: i just mean as an initial trail
10:14 YClan: Dang... I missed out on the Great Rotation.  Looks like it's over!?
10:14 tmoney20g: being that the two points are only 2.0 apart
10:15 esmal: best way I can answer that is enough room that the natural fluctations wont execute your order right away but also within your risk tolerance
10:16 YJH: Odd
10:16 lawrence5684: : When I read Delta under the Option Chain, it gives a percent and a plus/minus value for each weekly and monthly.  Is the plus/minus value reflective of the estimated point spread based on the volatility assigned to the stock.  In the case of AMZN, the Nov 16 Delta has a "point spread" of 204 points or 45%.  Is that correct?
10:16 YJH: Why does a stock drop right after I buy something at market price
10:17 esmal: YJH you have to make a sacrifice to the stock gods prior to buying
10:17 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: amzn volatility has faded....move coming?
10:18 YJH: Hmm. U may be right. Because dips always seem to happen right when I bite the bullet
10:18 AlphaInvestor: Lawrence - google Options Delta, there are lots of good definitions
10:18 YClan: yjh,   you could use a limit order and see if it also drops.
10:19 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: AMZN volume fading too
10:19 RandomDan: 78... the market reads your charts bt
10:20 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: It never did test its 200 day....amzn
10:20 YJH: @YClan, will take a look at limit order. I’m still fairly new and just trying to use up my day trades for the week
10:20 YJH: Damn TLRY hahahaha
10:20 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I thot that only happens to me  :)
10:21 JC_chart: amzn looks in a tight range and as u said zero volume ... trend is up on 5m but flat on my chart with choppy negative and positive values
10:21 YJH: We must offer our left pinky finger to the bright orange god
10:21 dragoon4zulu: what is everybody buying for Canada Day next wednesday the 17th ?
10:21 tmoney20g: maple syrup
10:22 tmoney20g: cases of it
10:22 streetglide: Molson
10:22 tmoney20g: cases of that too
10:22 RandomDan: pretty amazing bt, you said it needed a close above 76, it didn't, but then it made up for it overnight. Spooky doesn't begin to describe it.
10:22 tmoney20g: such flatness
10:22 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: actually Qs volume is fading....something going to finally happen soon!
10:24 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: does anybody know wha't gonna happen?  
10:24 tmoney20g: i can let you know at 4pm est
10:24 JC_chart: qqq ranging around yesterdays high
10:24 esmal: any love for 1 minute charts?

10:25 fred__w: darryl  no  but probability gives us clues  and keeps us from jumping the gun  hopefully
10:25 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: need answer NOW, to profit ;)
10:25 tmoney20g: guess what, a whole new week starts on monday
10:26 JC_chart: but negative energy coming in so ... could move below but it has held about for last hour plus
10:26 tmoney20g: esmal, i think we're done for teh day
10:26 fred__w: darryl  learn to read price volume  there is your answer  and it unfolds  you have to be patient for it  
10:26 tmoney20g: the*
10:26 YClan: Dragon,  for Canada day, I will buy some Schwepps.
10:26 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I  need another indicator
10:27 fred__w: darryl  youre on your own  then
10:27 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Canda Dry with gin
10:27 dragoon4zulu: Oh well no serious views-- Molson and Schwepps are great to drink but they wont 2x your $$
10:28 AlphaInvestor: Darryl - price will go up, then price will go down ... or vice versa
10:28 AlphaInvestor: Trade Management is key
10:28 dragoon4zulu: drag out your fie on TGODF
10:28 fred__w: alpha  +1
10:28 YClan: Darryl,  I actually like Canada Dry Gingera Ale with lime and Disaronno.
10:29 tmoney20g: buy low, sell high
10:29 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: uh oh,  down move?
10:30 AlphaInvestor: Canada Dry is da bomb
10:30 tmoney20g: morgan's so cute
10:30 tmoney20g: where's chen
10:30 fred__w: darryl  you should already know  how you will approach any scenario that arises  it should not be a surprise
10:31 YClan: 30 News Bot: Athenahealth (ATHN) has received bidder interest over USD 135/shr 
10:32 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: had the barkeep make me this drink last night i found on internet.  Bikini Martini.  Tropical drink.  4 oz coco rum, 2 oz vodka, 1/2 grenadine, pineapple juice,  awsome.
10:33 radon224: Jack Daniels and a shot glass for me.  I like to keep things simple.
10:34 YClan: radon,    yes but then you have  glass to wash.
10:34 radon224: nah, ethanol is a good disinfectant
10:35 YClan: ol' Ethan
10:36 YClan: TSLA is down at April/2018 lows.
10:36 YClan: bankruptcy secured
10:37 tmoney20g: taking it private, and in debt
10:37 YClan: I heard Dell wants to take Dell public again.
10:38 radon224: I have to remember to tune in to the next TSLA Quarterly Conf. Call so I can watch the circus.  I'll put a reminder on my calendar.
10:40 chenmann: lol yclan
10:40 YClan: Is 2019 the final year to get an electric car (tesla) tax credit from the govt??  
10:40 VolCrush: gm admin_tculs
10:40 VolCrush: gm groovers
10:41 YClan: volc volc volc     happy sunshine, put on your sunglasses.
10:41 admin_tculs: gm vol
10:42 YClan: GM looking good today for the Napolean's in the room.
10:42 VolCrush: rollin this over a bit atm, he?  /rty still in a world of hurt
them FINS did ok on E but doesn't luk like the market cares all that much
10:43 VolCrush: yah, sunshine but it's cold where i am, gots der long johns on....LOL
10:44 fred__w: vol  i engage if/when the mkt tests the lows and beyond
10:45 VolCrush: ok, let us knw when dat is
10:45 YClan: With rising interest rates... it really does not help banks, because bank trend is to sell fewer and fewer mortgages, so income from mortgages is downtrend for them though rates are rising.
10:45 tmoney20g: i want to see fred engage
10:45 tmoney20g: sounds like some space sci fi thing
10:46 tajtx: Market fading?
10:46 tmoney20g: today's first actual trend
10:46 tmoney20g: in one direction
10:46 Chappy: lag sucks
10:47 fred__w: tmoney  im a position trader  so i slowly work off inventory in either direction  theres a lot of prep for a big move  once inventory and price drops sufficiently  i begin accummulating the other direction
10:47 YClan: chappy, think of it is Slo-Mo where you soak in all the detail you miss of real-time.
10:47 tmoney20g: now get NQ back to 7150 and lets do that one again
10:47 fred__w: ..its a slow process
10:48 fred__w: ..but i believe higher probability of success  
10:49 Borat_the_Trader: i have stock you buy $0.25
That's nice!!
10:49 tmoney20g: wat
10:49 tmoney20g: HMNY ?
10:50 AlphaInvestor: Vol - based on the lackluster performance of der FINS, I have GTC order to close my MA^ at 50% profit
10:51 fred__w: tmoney  i likely will not engage the swing side  till my index shows signs of strength
10:51 YClan: GS is near to testing yesterday's 1 year lows again.
10:51 tmoney20g: i just hope i'm here when you engage
10:51 fred__w: ..that is  individual issues
10:51 tmoney20g: i want to see you go to plaid
10:52 VolCrush: yah well at least they didn't bomb, no idea wat their nums actually are but the tape isn't killing them; ain't great either.......lackluster is a good word to describle it.
10:52 fred__w: tmoney  im always active  readiong wise  but there are significant periods of waiting for price
10:55 radon224: News Article:  Sears close to deal to allow it to stay in business over the Holiday Season.  My question is "what's the point?"  It's like the saying in the movie Pet Semetary.....sometimes dead is better.
10:56 YClan: radon,  +1.   "All Sales Are Final".
10:56 RandomDan: I like Sears. Even went to one this year, and bought a rare American made wrench.
10:57 radon224: Get the people you hate a Sears gift card for Christmas.
10:57 RandomDan: I should get a frequent customer reward.
10:57 YClan: radon,   lol !
10:57 tmoney20g: i got a few toys r us ones to give out
10:58 tmoney20g: amzn should just buy sears
10:58 tmoney20g: then they can have amzn stores
10:59 YClan: Later guys... I gotta go put some cash into the credit union, and it's next door to an irish pub,so I might get derailed.
10:59 tmoney20g: then they can truely become "buy n large" from wall-e
11:00 radon224: I ordered my daughter a printer from AMZN.  Paid no shipping for "snail mail" shipping service.  Damned thing arrived the next day.  Crazy.
11:00 YClan: NFLX earnings are next week.
11:00 chenmann: later yclan
11:00 YClan: radon,  I know a lot of people who don't have prime, and don't pay for express shipping and get the item 1-2 days later...   I think the express shipping is a bogus upsell on AMZN.
11:01 radon224: yclan, agreed
11:01 chenmann: yep
11:02 radon224: I think if you order an item that's shipped by Amazon and not a third party, and you have a distribution warehouse near you....you are golden.
11:03 VolCrush: block chain a thing again?  RIOT from the depths of hell today
11:03 YClan: block chain smokers ?

11:13 streetglide: nope
11:13 mthfr_vaxxed: or i guess he changed the business too.... i bet there never was a business....
11:14 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I'm glad he's working with Trump.
11:14 mthfr_vaxxed: the world of penny stock companies that aren't..... actually companies
11:14 JC_chart: hasha as i said my appologies

11:15 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: If Qs can reverse over 173, rally might have legs.
11:15 VolCrush: this market reminds me of my last relationship, there are some serious TRUST issues running amuck
11:16 streetglide: yep
11:16 VolCrush: i don't think it gets legs if der fruit is below 220
11:16 JC_chart: well that's good you know that, will keep you safer
11:17 VolCrush: JPM is luking fugly, fur der dump
11:18 VolCrush: perhaps a Black Monday flush for capitulation
11:18 VolCrush: /rty she broke
11:21 VolCrush: yup, china names and some healthcare holdin bid

11:25 VolCrush: max pain on der fruit 220 - 22.5
11:26 VolCrush: yah /rty is garbage
11:26 RandomDan: uncle Cramer tweeted yesterday that baba was worth more than it's price on a component basis. But he separately says don't buy China.
11:26 radon224: I believe China announced a new record trade surplus with the U.S. today, despite all of the sanctions.  May have something to do with it.
11:26 VolCrush: well chit if Cramer said that, i'm buying China
11:26 RandomDan: of course he tweeted this like 10 minutes after I sold my BABA
11:26 chenmann: ha
11:27 RandomDan: AH
11:27 chenmann: rty lod
11:27 RandomDan: so if BABA goes up, he told you it was cheap. if it tanks, he told you not to buy China. Win-win
11:28 radon224: /es gapfill has bulls rethinking things
11:28 VolCrush: midcap are broke as well
11:28 VolCrush: FANGS don't luk healthy either
