16:31 Anonymous so far: What do y&aposall think about SQ tomorrow? Down?
16:31 VolCrush: *histograms
16:31 JC_chart: i do actually sometimes but not in that image
16:31 VolCrush: i tink SQ has lost all or most of their top shelf managers, apparently der CEO is an arse
16:32 JC_chart: in that image I am showing two different histograms one driven on breadth and volume and one driven on price
16:32 VolCrush: wats the delta rthen from one histo to the other?
16:32 VolCrush: ah ok
16:32 JC_chart: the move
16:32 JC_chart: or momentum
16:33 JC_chart: but here let me do a fib one so you dont think i am bsing you one sec
16:33 VolCrush: momentum in volume? volume and breadth?
16:33 VolCrush: btw, you should be able to post the chart directly in here 
16:33 JC_chart: yes as a raw input that is transformed by the indicator
16:38 JC_chart: this is one of the GC trades i did
16:38 JC_chart: i tried to post it right in here but gave me a bad size
16:39 JC_chart: the entry was at one fib and exit at another
16:39 VolCrush: got it, thanks
16:40 JC_chart: my sq chart says it is flat lined in a range so hard to tell what will happen tomorrow
16:40 admin_tculs: JC  please do not post outside links here
16:41 JC_chart: well how do you post an image in her admin_TCULS
16:41 VolCrush: s/he is tryin to post the TOS chart in here, but I and others don't know how to do that
16:44 AlphaInvestor: JC - make your chart smaller before clippping - I use WinDoze 10 Snipping Tool. Then past into the chat box, right click and Zoom to 10%. Then hit send
16:45 VolCrush: ty, Alpha
16:45 JC_chart: how small
16:45 VolCrush: 10%
16:45 Gus: can't wait until eveything can be shorted with ease
16:46 AlphaInvestor: 640 x 640 I believe, but not sure
16:46 VolCrush: LOL, shorting for the last 3 days has been as easy as it gets
16:47 Gus: anybody a strictly short saler here?
16:47 VolCrush: or what, Alpha said
16:47 JC_chart: k
16:48 Gus: also yeah, but the consistency of being able to short all the time so not just 3 days lol
16:48 JC_chart: been able to short gold for a long time LOL
16:49 Gus: yes yes for sure but easier lol, i guess I'm not on the JC_chart level yet haha
16:49 AlphaInvestor: Gus - you can short most liquid things, those that are NTB or HTB, you can often go Synthetic Short via options
16:50 AlphaInvestor: Sell an ATM call, buy an ATM put - viola ... you are synthetic short stock
16:50 Gus: only have 18k and ive shorted $SUPV $MDXG $INNT & $BFR easy plays but as i get better I don't want to implode from lok
16:50 AlphaInvestor: I have a couple Call Credit Spreads on BFR -- bearish play
16:51 Gus: yeah i got out of it awhile back but thinking of heading back in soon
16:51 VolCrush: i tink he a penny scalper
16:52 Gus: not all the time haha but percentages are huge on plays like that
16:52 Gus: bfr went down like 15% in the last week, i shorted $SUPV instead and got 7% before it reversed and now its down another 7% since i left
16:53 AlphaInvestor: Vol - ah, CCS too commish intensive for penny scalping
16:53 AlphaInvestor: SUPV doesn't trade options, I cannot be short in my IRA
16:53 Gus: h&s pattern with a terrible downtrend on those stocks is a consistent play that I've made but don't wait long enough to realize
16:53 Gus: the best gainz
16:54 Gus: also, laugh if you'd like, ive never touched options haha
16:55 Gus: just basic shorting and longing, mostly shorting, as im better at that.
16:58 JC_chart: wow TOS sure does make it hard for you
16:58 VolCrush: chit bronx, AH moves e.g. AMZN*
16:59 JC_chart:  
16:59 JC_chart: OMG did that work
16:59 JC_chart: so vol that was an NVDA trade i took
17:00 JC_chart: entered when histos and trend line were green at the bottom of the range fib and exited at the 23.6
17:01 VolCrush: DAMN u did it, way to persevere
17:01 JC_chart: i am not sure if that was more frustrating or when the time and sales stopped today on gc LOL
17:07 AlphaInvestor: you missed the part about right clicking and scaling down to 10%
17:08 AlphaInvestor: That way you can post a slightly bigger chart, scaled down so it doesn't burn so much buffer
17:08 RandomDan: I am back.
17:09 AlphaInvestor: whew
17:10 RandomDan: I see I shouldn't have sold BABA
17:11 408Spartan: Any idea how to enable After Hours/ Pre Market prices for the tickers in MarketWatch?
17:12 JC_chart: I am not sure how to scale it down on my mac actually

17:28 chenmannmobile: yes bt
17:29 chenmannmobile: if good , up we go
17:30 AlphaInvestor: BT - yes, I posted the banks that are reporting earlier
17:30 chenmannmobile: nflx er 16th al
17:31 NullTrader: Hi I have a study that was created by my own code. I was able to edit it before. Now when I right click it, it only shows a "calculator" but no code to edit. What did I do wrong?

17:31 blondetrader: well fingers crossed
17:31 blondetrader: from these prices the long would be so much more awesome
17:34 408Spartan: JC_chart can you post a s creenshot of what youre seeing? I couldnt find it.
17:36 JC_chart: what im seeing  for what?
17:36 408Spartan: the Setting youre talking bout
17:36 VolCrush: meh, meh
17:37 RandomDan: gap up tomorrow becoming more plausible
17:37 chenmannmobile: buy baba back dan
17:37 chenmannmobile: ah
17:37 408Spartan: Apparently you cant or so says Support "Hello! Sorry about the wait. Afterhours prices you will look at the bid and ask."
17:38 VolCrush: pics from bronx, becoming a 98% probibility with IV of 2%
17:38 AlphaInvestor: 408 - wrong!!
17:38 AlphaInvestor: But support don't know diddly some times
17:38 JC_chart: im short gc at 1227
17:38 amalia: Buy /YM
17:38 RandomDan: too late, sold at 141.90
17:39 RandomDan: I am not buying back at a loss
17:39 JC_chart: target is 1226. but might not get there on 1st try
17:39 408Spartan: AlphaInvestor thats what I thought i mean its a pretty simple utility just goddamn hard to find tht Setting
17:39 AlphaInvestor: 408 - add a new custom column - I named mine myLast ... put a single word inside    CLOSE   ... set the aggregation to 1 minute using the little box that defaults to D (daily)
17:39 RandomDan: I am long plenty of other stuff
17:40 amalia: 61 t trail
17:41 blondetrader: gc drop to 20
17:41 JC_chart: 404spart do you see the gear in your tooldbar header a
17:41 JC_chart: haha
17:41 AlphaInvestor:  
17:41 JC_chart: im hoping that for you with rty
17:41 blondetrader: and tomorrow if below that 1213
17:41 RandomDan: JC I think you will make money short gc
17:41 AlphaInvestor: 408 - also, make sure you click the box for EXT hours
17:42 AlphaInvestor: right click that post, zoom up to 100%
17:42 blondetrader: will prob do gc short tomorrow
17:42 amalia: P shape from 24,893
17:42 amalia: Intraday
17:43 VolCrush: i noticed the move in /gc today, kinda scratched myself but the $$$$ did dip a bit; inflation worries all over
17:43 JC_chart: I dont know  gc hit 126.6 5 times now  and my chart is now  has conflict
17:43 VolCrush: listening to the Grateful Dead eating pistachio ice cream
who, who has it better than us?
17:44 AlphaInvestor: NOBODY
17:44 JC_chart: i think it was the shorts covering after  the hbid up last night and early this morning and some hedging too
17:45 RandomDan: gc was just a fear play IMHO, fear be dissipating. It's not a good inflation hedge even if inflation actually became a thingm
17:45 AlphaInvestor: Timberland is a great inflation hedge! And I know just the guy ...
17:45 JC_chart: dont disagree but the market players become irrational on days like to day so....
17:46 RandomDan: yeah but if the market rises tomorrow, gc goes back to sleep
17:47 JC_chart: ya know GC has always a few great day trades every day
17:47 RandomDan: I don't really follow it. It's just on my watchlist for context.
17:48 JC_chart: and if youre right, it will march back to 1165 or so and that could be a good bit of trading to there
17:48 JC_chart: i like trading cl too but sometimes it is just too   whiphot and wicky candles so i trade gc
17:49 AlphaInvestor: Well, it was real today. Later Traders
17:49 JC_chart: I dont like es as i it is expensive and actually doesnt have that many great moves except when a plunge happens
17:49 RandomDan: No idea. I think it's going to hang around 1200, but no reasoning behind that.
17:49 chenmannmobile: later al
17:49 RandomDan: later Al
17:49 VolCrush: /cl is the most news driven product out there, to trade /cl you must follow the news on /cl and global macros
17:50 RandomDan: the mood in the room is different tonight. yesterday most of us were shell shocked
17:50 JC_chart: I just follow my chart for cl
17:50 JC_chart: when things agree and there is a fib range go in
17:50 JC_chart: there are usually 10 or so trades a day on the 3m
17:51 RandomDan: cl... I have no edge at all. Would never try it.
17:51 JC_chart: my charts have the edge
17:51 RandomDan: I don't know how many tankers are parked wherever... how many rigs this and that.
17:52 JC_chart: don't really give a you know what ... my chart indicators agree there i is a trade i take it as i beleive in my charts
17:53 JC_chart: not saying that with any obnoxiousness just saying that is the truth
17:53 chenmannmobile: i only trade cl during war
17:53 chenmannmobile: any war
17:53 RandomDan: Whatever works for you man.
17:53 JC_chart: i lost a lot of money  disagreeing with my chart and not beleiveing in my system ... once i paid attention and trusted my system its been great
17:53 RandomDan: war, charts, loaded dice
17:55 chenmannmobile: cnbc special, was today s flush the bottom?
17:55 RandomDan: 
17:56 blondetrader: ugh
17:57 RandomDan: my sense, and take it for what its worth, is tomorrow is big bounce #1, but I have no idea if it will hold (or even happen, just the voice in my head)
17:58 chenmannmobile: did fill that gap es 2713, and bounced right off
17:58 RandomDan: Also, while I am playing a clairvoyant trader on TV, I would look for GOOG close to 1120
17:59 RandomDan: 1115 maybe. Something like that.
18:00 VolCrush: welp, if CNBS said that, we have 500 points more to the downside   
18:00 RandomDan: Of course ERs could be awful and the whole house of cards goes to the floor.
18:00 VolCrush: or short the gap up, LOL
18:00 RandomDan: What are those fine folks saying?
18:01 VolCrush: or read the *ucking tape
18:01 chenmannmobile: "it s time to nibble" cramer
18:01 VolCrush: i would never much less take a bite out of Cramer
18:01 VolCrush: *I would never nibble...
18:01 RandomDan: Cramer would be good if he didn't push his book so much.
18:01 VolCrush: really is he tasty
18:02 VolCrush: ??
18:02 RandomDan: I like the guy. It's like having an uncle who's a used car salesman.
18:03 VolCrush: you shouldn't refer to Marcos that way
18:04 RandomDan: I wouldn't buy a car from him but I like the stories.
18:05 chenmannmobile: o wow futures up lot....so far

18:32 amalia: Hoping polarity stays positive
18:32 tmoney20g: so that's almost 100 pts since 3pm
18:36 amalia: Yep. #TeamWideStops ftw
18:36 amalia: And for the losses. haha
18:40 EasyE: I just need SPY to open at 288 and I'll be done.

06:47 Deep: Big dips always comes in threes. Get ready
06:49 Eedie: My numbers are way off on GC.  I show 19-21 as support and 27 as target higher.  So I'm staying away because I'm way off target compared to your numbers..
06:50 Eedie: I think I'm staying with es and rty.
06:50 Eedie: However, silver looks interesting.
06:51 blondetrader: ohhh I havent looked at that in a long while

07:53 Vimes: not a tax guy, but i would guess at your nomral tax rate
07:53 blondetrader: you can prob goog it
07:53 Regretfulflyer: I’ve tried it’s not Exactly easy to understand
07:54 blondetrader: hold on
07:54 blondetrader: it is 50% of the gain at your current tax rate
07:55 Regretfulflyer: Thanks
07:55 blondetrader: ur welcome wow canada actually lower cap gain overall that us 
07:55 blondetrader: thats the only rate lower but nice'
07:55 AlphaInvestor: I get taxes withheld on lots of ADRs from lots of countries. I don't keep track, it's a cost of doin' biz
07:56 Regretfulflyer: So 50% of my dividends are withheld so I can tell the IRS to give me more because I took a loss
07:56 tmoney20g: hi hi
07:57 streetglide: O Canada......our home and native land
07:57 Regretfulflyer: Can we buy into the ASX, and the British stock market?
07:57 blondetrader: your taxed on 50% of the gain
07:57 Regretfulflyer: Gain is dividends yes?
07:58 blondetrader: yes if the div was 100 you r taxed on 50.00
07:58 blondetrader: not sure about how much loss can be offset
07:58 Regretfulflyer: Talk about a kick below the belt in taxes ouch
07:58 blondetrader: but i think it would wash
07:59 blondetrader: well we r taxed on 100% of our gains so
07:59 Regretfulflyer: Does the UK and AUS have banks on the NYSE that offer dividends?
08:00 blondetrader: that I do not know
08:00 tmoney20g: someone's gotta pay for all that maple syrup
08:00 tmoney20g: esmal, whatcha eyeing ?
08:00 Eedie: LOL tmoney
08:01 tmoney20g: o yay, it worked.
08:01 tmoney20g: i have trailstop for options
08:01 Regretfulflyer: Someone talked to us at the local 145 plumbers union about stocks this year I’m the only one who made a portfolio and self managing it. Were told diversify in other countries but safely in banks
08:01 dug03: @Regret... don't forget USA gives a foreign tax credit amongst all that mess, I never paid attention,, neither urgent nor important to figure out
08:02 Eedie: Ok  anybody have BABA?
08:02 streetglide: Good for you Regret...good luck with it
08:02 dug03: I know it cost me more tx with SAN, than it did with ITUB
08:03 blondetrader: I do
08:03 blondetrader: pcs
08:03 Regretfulflyer: Why I’m trying to figure out how to buy into the UK and AUS and CAN
08:03 tmoney20g: buy a house in each country
08:03 tmoney20g: then you'll live everywhere
08:03 Regretfulflyer: ....that’s more money than I have atm
08:03 tmoney20g: oh
08:04 tmoney20g: i feel your pain
08:04 Regretfulflyer: Think my total invested in is $2k
08:04 john: Good morning all! Woke up with MU going up?
08:04 tmoney20g: i have 3 houses in 1 place
08:04 tmoney20g: instead of 1 house in 3 places
08:04 lilFish: does anyone know the trick to making earningscast play?
08:04 Regretfulflyer: Can I has a house?
08:05 AlphaInvestor: Tmoney - if you are using a Stop with options, then you don't understand options
08:05 blondetrader: omg ya dont do that
08:05 Regretfulflyer: ??
08:06 john: Alph- you said the stock I bot with my strategy was bad. But I made 400$
08:07 Eedie: Wtg on BABA BT
08:07 Regretfulflyer: I don’t day trade it’s like Russian roulette too risky
08:08 Regretfulflyer: Plus warren buffet says the $$$ is in long holding for dividends so did JP Morgan
08:09 Regretfulflyer: Does anyone know a better REIT than O, or STAG?
08:09 john: Yeah, I am starting to notice the long hold is better
08:11 Regretfulflyer: Only profitable REIT I found in Canada is SHAW but is there any under 5% yield but pays well?
08:11 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Casino almost open!
08:11 Regretfulflyer: Profitable
08:12 tmoney20g: paddle wheel casino ?
08:12 tmoney20g: are you in the ozarks ?
08:13 Regretfulflyer: Colorado
08:13 streetglide: Ozark is a good show
08:13 lilFish: hi street - love Ozark
08:13 streetglide: hey
08:14 Regretfulflyer: What is Ozark?
08:14 lilFish: show on netflix
08:14 Paul: If a company buys back half it's stock, does the obligation to the dividend remain the same on the repurchased shares?
08:14 Regretfulflyer: Ah, then no I can’t afford Netflix I’m buying stocks instead
08:15 streetglide: a company is not going to pay itself on those repurchased shares
08:16 streetglide: everyone else still gets their same divy
08:16 Paul: so that would mean it's retained earnings
08:16 Paul: would rise.
08:16 Regretfulflyer: Is there a REIT in the UK that’s on the NYSE? Under 5% yield but profitable?
08:17 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I think Paul is asking if the rermaining shares are required to be paid a dividend.  The answer is yes, but the board makes those declarations and can change it.
08:18 Paul: Excellent.
08:20 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Dividends are great, but I would not hold a stock in a downtrend just to get the dividend.  That's just me.
08:20 Regretfulflyer: Buffet does and selling in a down trend you’re throwing money down the toilet
08:21 streetglide: actually dividends reduce retained earnings, btw
08:21 lilFish: so noone here listens to conference calls on earningscast?
08:22 Regretfulflyer: No WiFi at my apartment only cell phone so nope
08:23 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I can't argue with what you said, Regret, that is what Buffet does.   But like I said, it's just me.  I like to buy stocks into momentum,  not bottom fish....most of the time anyway.
08:23 streetglide: you can probably go to JPM site and get a recording, fish
08:24 lilFish: yea - i was hoping this would be one convenient place to listen to all of them and not have to give my email to every corporate site I'm interested in listening to
08:24 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Lil, not me.  The Big Fish pay big money to get that info about 15 seconds before the little fish, so it's already moving before we get the info.  
08:24 G3_: you can go to the company website, get the phone # five mins beffore conference call begins.  As a last resort 
08:24 G3_: beat me to it Street
08:24 Regretfulflyer: I’m trying to find banks and reits in the UK that offer dividends. Google says 15m searches found. The pages don’t offer information
08:25 lilFish: thx -that sounds like a good option
08:25 fred__w: important gap shows in an app i have  suggesting a halfway pt
08:26 fred__w: but  as always  play the tape
08:26 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: they pay millions to get that info before everyone else.  
08:26 Regretfulflyer: Why do y’all want to listen to a boring conference call
08:26 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: amazon has rebounded 80 bucks
08:27 tmoney20g: @esmal what you gonna do
08:27 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: scuse me 75
08:27 Regretfulflyer: And it cost $2k to buy nope
08:27 Regretfulflyer: I’d rather buy LMT cheaper and more dividends
08:28 Regretfulflyer: Dividend
08:29 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: LMT earnings on 10/23
08:30 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: may have a lot of stocks bounce off their 200 day averages today
08:31 Regretfulflyer: Question? Does France have banks listed on the nyse?
08:32 thetiderider777: chart lags badly again today
08:33 Regretfulflyer: I’m hungry I’m going to eat breakfast nice talking to y’all ^_~>
08:34 unasol: has anyone found a better alternative to TOS, with decent indicators?
08:34 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: SQ had dropped over 30% from its high, and still has not touched its 200 day
08:35 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: after a gap up now they'er selling SQ
08:35 fred__w: ibelieve i dodged a bullet with this open  now at even strength
08:36 radon224: nasty chart lag, again
08:37 JC_chart: GM
08:37 fred__w: radon  i suggest learning to trade with prices extant  do the chart stuff prior  just a suggestion
08:37 RandomFamily: good morning
08:37 JC_chart: BT if you are still in RTY i am impressed on your ability to weather a ride
08:37 JC_chart: but it is paying short now
08:38 radon224: I use "something else" to get my quotes fred
08:38 JC_chart: GC cant decide what it wants to do alot of conflict on my chart
08:38 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: CNBC sure is trying to talk up the markets.  "Russell 2000 has now exited it's correction".
08:38 JC_chart: im long 221 aapl calls
08:39 ranchman: team
08:39 fred__w: rad  nice
08:39 fred__w: darryl  there can be another test
08:40 ranchman: team  I have $2500 in my "cash & sweep vehicle" but is not in my  "option buying power fund".  Why?  I deposited two days ago?  help...
08:40 michael9844: whats going on with TOS and lagging charts
08:41 michael9844: Pretty sad for such a large and well known platform
08:41 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Anybody else spot the Qs selling at the open even though it gapped?  Looked like pretty good downside volume
08:41 fred__w: ranch  you have to play with that  its not obvious  at least it wasnt for me  how to tell if cash is settled
08:42 fred__w: ..there is a way tho
08:42 fred__w: ..cash avail for withdrawal is key
08:42 fred__w: imo
08:42 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Td settles way faster than Scottrade did that's for sure.
08:43 ranchman: so I guess it takes more than two days?
08:44 tmoney20g: over night for options, could be T+2 for equities
08:44 tmoney20g: the trade desk would know better answers
08:44 4205: Not the only one who has a lagging chart, right?
08:44 Chappy: Good day all. Is anyone else getting massive chart lag?
08:45 tmoney20g: yes, everyone will have it at the open, too much traffic
08:45 Anonymous so far: yep second day this has happened
08:45 4205: Yup. Thats unfortunate
08:45 pietro: Why is the chart lagging?
08:45 michael9259: yes. second day for me
08:45 Chappy: crappers
08:45 michael9259: prophet is working correctly it seems but....
08:46 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: opinions on GDX?  Looks like breakout yesterday, pulling back today.  I've been burned on this one before!
08:46 fred__w: daryl  yes  a day   it seems
08:47 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Chart lag is bc everything you think is happening today actually happened yesterday ;)
08:47 fred__w: unless we test lows  im done for the day  i think
08:48 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Already fred?  You cashed in some calls?
08:49 fred__w: darryl  i went long prematurely  and balanced at the open  gratefully  the mkt gapped up
08:50 michael0093: in a surprising twist... my tos is running fine... unlike yestrerday, active trader not synched with charts or level 2.  try unplugging the modem for a minute.
08:50 JC_chart: out of aapl long, waiting for /GC to get out of its range... I would wait on GDX too it is in a stair step down move but gold hasnt made up its mind yet today, my charts look more choppy than anything else on gold
08:50 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: k, thanks GC
08:50 fred__w: darryl  i accomplished my goal tho
08:50 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: cool
08:51 fred__w: ..and thx to the gap up  with minimal damage
08:51 AlphaInvestor: Til Ray
08:52 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: yeah, GDX is pulling back from overbought yesterday outside BB's
08:52 Dimka: Jeez, everything green except my holdings
08:52 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I know the feeling dimka!   
08:53 AlphaInvestor: DING - closed HPQ short call for a penny
08:53 fred__w: darryl  in position trading  relative long short holdings is key
08:54 featherweight: I believe I can fly
08:55 featherweight: I believe I can touch the sky
08:55 featherweight: I think about spooz every night and day
08:55 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I'm the boy plunger  :)
08:56 JC_chart: market makers just got sick of waiting on gold and threw a big whack of cash to push it down lets see if it will stay and if it does gdx will follow
08:56 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: That refers to Jesse Livermore btw  :)
08:56 tmoney20g: just tested the TRAILSTOPLIMT
08:56 Thlinx: I still see the QQQ going lower
08:56 fred__w: darryl  yes  i know
08:56 tmoney20g: it worked, but i had it set too narrow of a trail
08:57 tmoney20g: gonna be a learning curve here
08:57 Bealzybub: ACRX trading halted ahead of FDA meeting..........
08:58 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Once bitten, twice shy on miners.  Actually more than once bitten.
08:59 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Miners are literally near the bottom 5 of 200 sectors in Investors Business daily.  
09:00 JC_chart: I dont disagree but there are many great day trades in miners and gold futures with the right setups
09:00 streetglide: I cant ever seem to time the miners etf's worth a chit
09:00 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: might've went up a little yesterday.  Have not checked.
09:00 JC_chart: just day trades
09:01 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Me neither Street, but I think that's bc they have been on a downtrend, so rebound breakouts get hammered
09:02 streetglide: a lot tof times they dont follow gc all that well intraday
09:02 JC_chart: the gold futures actually are better to trade
09:02 blondetrader: am short gc
09:02 blondetrader: 23.5
09:02 JC_chart: hard to make money on options with gdx
09:02 JC_chart: yep im short from 1224.7
09:03 JC_chart: crossed  the midpoint target is 1222.8
09:04 JC_chart: and im out at 1222.7
09:04 JC_chart: so u never coulda got that move with options on gdx ,, but u can with futures
09:06 streetglide: gc is sort of like cl...you get these rips and wooshes for no apparent reason at times
09:07 AlphaInvestor: Street - it isn't "no apparent reason" it is geopolitics
09:07 JC_chart: its traders they drive the swooshes and that volatility is where the money is
09:07 streetglide: works both ways JC
09:08 JC_chart: yeah but the chart shows the moves so the setups are pretty clear
09:08 streetglide: intraday Al in a 5 min time frame isnt geo
09:08 JC_chart: for example look at the nounce in GC right now you could see that bounce coming back to the midpoint and continue down by seeing the momentum
09:10 AlphaInvestor: Street - okay, you are right at 1-min and 5-min ... prices are RANDOM
09:11 AlphaInvestor: sometimes we randomly get multpile bars in a row in the same direction
09:11 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I don't trade options, just buy or sell short
09:11 JC_chart: sorry guys beg to differ on the whooshes
09:11 JC_chart: they are pure market manipulation on GC and cl
09:11 fred__w: alpha  fractal  you mean  :)
09:12 streetglide: agree JC
09:12 AlphaInvestor: Fred - no, I mean Random at those timeframes
09:12 fred__w: ..tho i dont use 1min
09:12 AlphaInvestor: Fred - but yes, prices are fractal in nature
09:12 JC_chart: its spoofing and its knowing ahead of time who needs to hedge and trading that news
09:13 JC_chart: and it is programmed algorithims that move from fib line to fib line during the day
09:13 AlphaInvestor: is JC off his meds again   ;-)
09:13 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: My personal opinion is, I receive better candle signals on 5 minute charts
09:13 blondetrader: haha he is correct
09:13 streetglide: exactly
09:13 fred__w: ..bcuz  they arent  as you suggest  as useful for trading decisions
09:14 JC_chart: i like the 3m on oil and gold
09:14 streetglide: there is a reason you dont trade them Al
09:14 fred__w: ..i do you 5 with 15 to get context
09:14 fred__w: use*
09:15 chenmann: jpm red
09:15 chenmann: careful
09:15 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: does anybody besides me think that ebay could plunge on earnings coming up?  I dunno, but chart looks WEAK
09:15 AlphaInvestor: order in to close TLRY long call at intrinsic that matches today's intraday high
09:16 AlphaInvestor: Darryl - EBAY complaining that AMZN stealing customers ... not a good sign
09:16 esmal:   morninig all
09:16 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: morning
09:17 chenmann: out spy
09:17 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I could see ebay plunging to a 26 handle
09:18 esmal: @tmoney, no clue yet
09:19 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I hate trading on earnings though, unless wer
09:19 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: shoot....unless we're in a clear bear market.
09:20 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: shorting that is.
09:20 tmoney20g: esmal
09:20 tmoney20g: i have trailstops now
09:20 michael9259: charts are fine now but, man, i can't trade here if this thing can't handle the US open! developers need to put in some overtime this weekend.
09:21 Tanya: GM, holly wow, been busy not dare checking portfolio
09:21 streetglide: hated seeing the overnight rampage....not good to buy the gap ups and hard to short cause it could have gapped and go'd......is go'd a word?
09:21 JC_chart: /ES banging on the bottom of its range here, chart says we go down
09:21 Tanya: Are you all scared yet?
09:21 JC_chart: to 2775 i bet
09:21 JC_chart: which is midpoint
09:22 esmal: good to hear!
09:23 tmoney20g: i tried 2 trailstoplimit, but got stopped out early
09:23 tmoney20g: gotta figure this out
09:23 tmoney20g: think i'll just try trailstop 
09:24 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Tanya, me don't trust this bounce at all.  MHO.
09:25 AlphaInvestor: Tmoney - what multiple of ATR are yoiu setting yoiur trail stop to ?   Hint, Hint
09:25 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: there is a lot of indecision after the gap
09:25 JC_chart: 2755 sorry for mistake
09:26 chenmann: out intc
09:26 tmoney20g: multiple ?
09:27 VET tryng to make money: What just happened
09:27 tmoney20g: i went potty
09:27 VET tryng to make money: So did the market
09:28 Tanya: Darryl, I am stuck here and waiting for correction to pass
09:28 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: If I could count on the Qs trading in a $1 range all day, I think I could make money.
09:28 VET tryng to make money: This market finishes in the red tonight .
09:29 StrikeOne: My stock scanner is incredibly slow today. Anyone else?
09:29 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: It could finish WAY in the red.
09:29 StrikeOne: Yesterday charts and scanner were useless to me.
09:29 tajtx: What makes you think so VET?
09:30 tmoney20g: esmal, on the website tho, doesn't show my filled sold orders
09:30 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: what's a stock scanner?  chart?
09:30 tmoney20g: only the buys
09:30 tmoney20g: any idea why that is ?
09:30 VET tryng to make money: We are not out of it and I think people will wait until Monday
09:30 tmoney20g: or anyone else using stops
09:30 VET tryng to make money: Instead of holding o Er the weekend
09:30 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I haven't traded anything
09:30 VET tryng to make money: Too many headlines
09:30 tajtx: OK thanks.     
09:30 esmal: i dont have the answer for that but I think when you enable advanced features it states that on the page
09:31 AlphaInvestor: Tmoney - you EXPECT the price to move by the ATR, so setting the trailing stop to less than the ATR almost guarantees yoiu will be stopped out
09:32 VET tryng to make money: Still tempted to by Starbucks
09:32 loneoak: Any thoughts on JetBlue?
09:33 nic007: Hi all- anyone use any subcription services they Recommend?? Raging Bull came across my desk--
09:33 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Vet, funny you mention SBUX.  I am thinking about shorting it, but want to see more weakness, but might not get it.
09:33 VET tryng to make money: Investitute
09:33 AlphaInvestor: Nic - you need to learn to make your own decisions.
09:33 VET tryng to make money: I’m in for the long I’ll sell against it
09:33 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: In fact, I have it on my screen right now.
09:34 VET tryng to make money: It’s up a bit that’s why I’m not in it now
09:34 nic007: Thanks Alpha. Yes, I agree.
09:34 AlphaInvestor: Nic - think about it, if they were good at trading ... they would be trading, not selling magic eleixir
09:34 esmal: lol
09:35 nic007: But as a newer trader, I paid for some mentorship that HAS helped, but most of those "alert subscriptions"  (couple I tried) were not helpful to me.
09:35 esmal: what did you exactly learn from your mentorship?
09:36 AlphaInvestor: Nic - attend Swim Lessons, taught free by TOS every day the market is open. Free eduction, free mentorship in the chat by SLS
09:36 Vimes: if you are an investor, go to hulbert digest and they rank some of the subscription services, for day trading i wouldn't trust any of the youtube junk
09:36 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: SBUX:  Ackman said he was buying it over the last 3 months, but then all of a sudden he wants the world to know he's done that.  So is he trying to dump his shares now into his advertisement?   15 million shares.   Either that or he is trying to talk up the price.
09:37 nic007: Alpha- ok thanks for that.
09:37 Kev : Sorry I am new to the TOS and trying to put in a trade. I kept getting ‘Illegal -1 Shares’. Can someone explain what that means?
09:37 JC_chart: I think tos lessons are great on their tools, but their mentorship is teaching you to take things like MACD crosses and well... iI have not seen that as a consistently winning strategy so i  was not impressed with their mentorship
09:38 Vimes: Kev, call the trade desk, either not appropriate margin approval, or funds available
09:38 Kev : Ok thanks @Vimes
09:38 tmoney20g: 3 for 3 today, feels nice
09:38 admin_tculs: Kev   call trade desk      800-672-2098� 
09:39 tmoney20g: esmal just filled trailstop
09:39 tmoney20g: i like that
09:39 JC_chart: nice .. happy friday
09:39 esmal: in the green>
09:39 esmal: ?*
09:40 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Qs trading in a $1 range.....still
09:40 JC_chart: im short GC since 1223.3
09:40 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: $1.30 actually
09:40 AlphaInvestor: Dayrrl - large investors like Ackman must disclose their positions quarterly
09:40 kaotekmonk: anyone in RGSE? your thoughts for the weekend?
09:41 JC_chart: taregt is 1221 but may not be strong enough to get their
09:41 tmoney20g: esmal yes
09:41 tmoney20g: just trading 1 contract
09:41 esmal: nice
09:41 tmoney20g: get to learn this
09:41 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: True Alpha, forgot about that
09:42 AlphaInvestor: Monk - nobody in here trades worthless penny stocks
09:42 AlphaInvestor: Ackman is not above the idea of "talking his book" tho
09:42 JC_chart: the range on the rgse is  0.10 and it is in a flatlined trend, i think there are other places you can make money with less risk if you want to hold over the weekend
09:43 JC_chart: im out of gc at 1221
09:44 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Ackman:  but if a big player wants to unload 15 million shares at a resistance level, he has to get players in to buy so the price doesn't plunge.
09:44 kaotekmonk: worthless? wow. must be in the wrong chatroom then.
09:44 AlphaInvestor: yup
09:45 chenmann: think tlry wants 155 al
09:45 AlphaInvestor: I will be out long before 155, option expires today
09:45 kaotekmonk: thanks jc_chart at least someone here has a career for advice.
09:45 radon224: AI used to say that about pot stocks, but something happened
09:46 chenmann: o i c
09:46 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: all I can tell you, is that when I look at a chart of SBUX i see a huge plunge in june, and a rocket back to the top.   That is not a good omen for a breakout to the upside.
09:46 chenmann: may get close today .... tlry
09:46 AlphaInvestor: DING - TLRY long call closed
09:47 AlphaInvestor: now I am only left with Bearish TLRY stuff - I feel much better
09:47 chenmann: haha nice trade .... even tho it was an accident
09:48 AlphaInvestor: made thousands on that accident
09:48 Vimes: a happy accident
09:48 AlphaInvestor: it was a 105 call, do the math
09:48 streetglide: happy endings are good
09:49 Vimes: but you were short stock, did you buy back on the open?
09:49 chenmann: i d close that bearish tlry stuff too ....al
09:49 AlphaInvestor: I bot back days ago
09:49 Vimes: oic, nice job
09:50 AlphaInvestor: I bot back thousands ago
09:50 fred__w: chen  on the opening  i was able to escape my longs with minimal damage  lesson learned
09:50 Vimes: i'm a bit suprised how well the pot stocks are holding in these last few days
09:50 AlphaInvestor: Chen - what I have left is a 185/190 ccs
09:50 chenmann: o
09:51 chenmann: vimes , agreed
09:51 chenmann: 12th today
09:51 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: SBUX:  I just drew a trendline from the peak in June 2017 to recent, downsloping,  price broke out on ackman announcement and then reversed below it again.  It could try another breakout, dunno.
09:51 AlphaInvestor: Chen - GTC order in to close at > 75% profit
09:51 chenmann: ha nice
09:51 chenmann: gl
09:52 AlphaInvestor: SBUIX was trying a Cup&Handle - but der market broke the handle
09:52 chenmann: chit, spike, looks like i closed my longs too early
09:52 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: True.
09:52 chenmann: tlry hod
09:53 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: What I am saying with SBUX is, I am in wait and see mode.  no action.
09:54 WYCOWBOY: Vimes, I am also.  Where does this $ come from?
09:54 fred__w: time for coffee
09:57 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: money comes from the fed, on their computer :)
09:58 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I'm already wired.  Woke up early.
09:59 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: man, these Qs are stuck in a range.  Interesting to see if which way they break
10:01 marc: anyone know how to add VIX to plot on chart you're working with
10:01 fred__w: darryl  i think probability favors south  but we'll see
10:01 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: my weekly trendline on SBUX crosses over to about 57.70.  That is the price I'm watching for.
10:02 Mhawk: Anyone had any experience with Charlottes Web? I hear it hit the OTC market yesterday?
10:02 marc: pot legal oct 17
10:03 Gmoney: What’s good today ?

10:04 marc: nov 2 amrn straddles
10:05 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: here Qs go down again in range....geez
10:06 DrHouse: Morning traders
10:08 Momoney: Exciting times ahead for acbff-can you say make me a millionaire!!
10:08 tmoney20g: calm down
10:09 tmoney20g: are you familiar with what happened in oregon ?
10:09 RandomDan: good morning
10:09 RandomDan: bt around?
10:10 blondetrader: yep
10:10 blondetrader: gm Dan
10:11 AlphaInvestor: berging all der potsters
10:12 RandomDan: hey bt, Al
10:12 RandomDan: what did /es print at the open?
10:12 RandomDan: I missed it.
10:12 tmoney20g: esmal, what would you set for a p1775 ?
10:13 tmoney20g: say you bought at 5.00 and wanted to take it to at least 7.00 ?
10:13 blondetrader: I wanna say 78
10:13 esmal: i cant say, amazon is trading sideways atm
10:14 tmoney20g: i just mean as an initial trail
10:14 YClan: Dang... I missed out on the Great Rotation.  Looks like it's over!?
10:14 tmoney20g: being that the two points are only 2.0 apart
10:15 esmal: best way I can answer that is enough room that the natural fluctations wont execute your order right away but also within your risk tolerance
10:16 YJH: Odd
10:16 lawrence5684: : When I read Delta under the Option Chain, it gives a percent and a plus/minus value for each weekly and monthly.  Is the plus/minus value reflective of the estimated point spread based on the volatility assigned to the stock.  In the case of AMZN, the Nov 16 Delta has a "point spread" of 204 points or 45%.  Is that correct?
10:16 YJH: Why does a stock drop right after I buy something at market price
10:17 esmal: YJH you have to make a sacrifice to the stock gods prior to buying
10:17 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: amzn volatility has faded....move coming?
10:18 YJH: Hmm. U may be right. Because dips always seem to happen right when I bite the bullet
10:18 AlphaInvestor: Lawrence - google Options Delta, there are lots of good definitions
10:18 YClan: yjh,   you could use a limit order and see if it also drops.
10:19 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: AMZN volume fading too
10:19 RandomDan: 78... the market reads your charts bt
10:20 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: It never did test its 200 day....amzn
10:20 YJH: @YClan, will take a look at limit order. I’m still fairly new and just trying to use up my day trades for the week
10:20 YJH: Damn TLRY hahahaha
10:20 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I thot that only happens to me  :)
10:21 JC_chart: amzn looks in a tight range and as u said zero volume ... trend is up on 5m but flat on my chart with choppy negative and positive values
10:21 YJH: We must offer our left pinky finger to the bright orange god
10:21 dragoon4zulu: what is everybody buying for Canada Day next wednesday the 17th ?
10:21 tmoney20g: maple syrup
10:22 tmoney20g: cases of it
10:22 streetglide: Molson
10:22 tmoney20g: cases of that too
10:22 RandomDan: pretty amazing bt, you said it needed a close above 76, it didn't, but then it made up for it overnight. Spooky doesn't begin to describe it.
10:22 tmoney20g: such flatness
10:22 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: actually Qs volume is fading....something going to finally happen soon!
10:24 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: does anybody know wha't gonna happen?  
10:24 tmoney20g: i can let you know at 4pm est
10:24 JC_chart: qqq ranging around yesterdays high
10:24 esmal: any love for 1 minute charts?

10:24 tmoney20g: on 3 charts
10:25 fred__w: darryl  no  but probability gives us clues  and keeps us from jumping the gun  hopefully
10:25 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: need answer NOW, to profit ;)
10:25 tmoney20g: guess what, a whole new week starts on monday
10:26 JC_chart: but negative energy coming in so ... could move below but it has held about for last hour plus
10:26 tmoney20g: esmal, i think we're done for teh day
10:26 fred__w: darryl  learn to read price volume  there is your answer  and it unfolds  you have to be patient for it  
10:26 tmoney20g: the*
10:26 YClan: Dragon,  for Canada day, I will buy some Schwepps.
10:26 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I  need another indicator
10:27 fred__w: darryl  youre on your own  then
10:27 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Canda Dry with gin
10:27 dragoon4zulu: Oh well no serious views-- Molson and Schwepps are great to drink but they wont 2x your $$
10:28 AlphaInvestor: Darryl - price will go up, then price will go down ... or vice versa
10:28 AlphaInvestor: Trade Management is key
10:28 dragoon4zulu: drag out your fie on TGODF
10:28 fred__w: alpha  +1
10:28 YClan: Darryl,  I actually like Canada Dry Gingera Ale with lime and Disaronno.
10:29 tmoney20g: buy low, sell high
10:29 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: uh oh,  down move?
10:30 AlphaInvestor: Canada Dry is da bomb
10:30 tmoney20g: morgan's so cute
10:30 tmoney20g: where's chen
10:30 fred__w: darryl  you should already know  how you will approach any scenario that arises  it should not be a surprise
10:31 YClan: 30 News Bot: Athenahealth (ATHN) has received bidder interest over USD 135/shr 
10:32 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: had the barkeep make me this drink last night i found on internet.  Bikini Martini.  Tropical drink.  4 oz coco rum, 2 oz vodka, 1/2 grenadine, pineapple juice,  awsome.
10:33 radon224: Jack Daniels and a shot glass for me.  I like to keep things simple.
10:34 YClan: radon,    yes but then you have  glass to wash.
10:34 radon224: nah, ethanol is a good disinfectant
10:35 YClan: ol' Ethan
10:36 YClan: TSLA is down at April/2018 lows.
10:36 YClan: bankruptcy secured
10:37 tmoney20g: taking it private, and in debt
10:37 YClan: I heard Dell wants to take Dell public again.
10:38 radon224: I have to remember to tune in to the next TSLA Quarterly Conf. Call so I can watch the circus.  I'll put a reminder on my calendar.
10:40 chenmann: lol yclan
10:40 YClan: Is 2019 the final year to get an electric car (tesla) tax credit from the govt??  
10:40 VolCrush: gm admin_tculs
10:40 VolCrush: gm groovers
10:41 YClan: volc volc volc     happy sunshine, put on your sunglasses.
10:41 admin_tculs: gm vol
10:42 YClan: GM looking good today for the Napolean's in the room.
10:42 VolCrush: rollin this over a bit atm, he?  /rty still in a world of hurt
them FINS did ok on E but doesn't luk like the market cares all that much
10:43 VolCrush: yah, sunshine but it's cold where i am, gots der long johns on....LOL
10:44 fred__w: vol  i engage if/when the mkt tests the lows and beyond
10:45 VolCrush: ok, let us knw when dat is
10:45 YClan: With rising interest rates... it really does not help banks, because bank trend is to sell fewer and fewer mortgages, so income from mortgages is downtrend for them though rates are rising.
10:45 tmoney20g: i want to see fred engage
10:45 tmoney20g: sounds like some space sci fi thing
10:46 tajtx: Market fading?
10:46 tmoney20g: today's first actual trend
10:46 tmoney20g: in one direction
10:46 Chappy: lag sucks
10:47 fred__w: tmoney  im a position trader  so i slowly work off inventory in either direction  theres a lot of prep for a big move  once inventory and price drops sufficiently  i begin accummulating the other direction
10:47 YClan: chappy, think of it is Slo-Mo where you soak in all the detail you miss of real-time.
10:47 tmoney20g: now get NQ back to 7150 and lets do that one again
10:47 fred__w: ..its a slow process
10:48 fred__w: ..but i believe higher probability of success  
10:49 Borat_the_Trader: i have stock you buy $0.25
That's nice!!
10:49 tmoney20g: wat
10:49 tmoney20g: HMNY ?
10:50 AlphaInvestor: Vol - based on the lackluster performance of der FINS, I have GTC order to close my MA^ at 50% profit
10:51 fred__w: tmoney  i likely will not engage the swing side  till my index shows signs of strength
10:51 YClan: GS is near to testing yesterday's 1 year lows again.
10:51 tmoney20g: i just hope i'm here when you engage
10:51 fred__w: ..that is  individual issues
10:51 tmoney20g: i want to see you go to plaid
10:52 VolCrush: yah well at least they didn't bomb, no idea wat their nums actually are but the tape isn't killing them; ain't great either.......lackluster is a good word to describle it.
10:52 fred__w: tmoney  im always active  readiong wise  but there are significant periods of waiting for price
10:55 radon224: News Article:  Sears close to deal to allow it to stay in business over the Holiday Season.  My question is "what's the point?"  It's like the saying in the movie Pet Semetary.....sometimes dead is better.
10:56 YClan: radon,  +1.   "All Sales Are Final".
10:56 RandomDan: I like Sears. Even went to one this year, and bought a rare American made wrench.
10:57 radon224: Get the people you hate a Sears gift card for Christmas.
10:57 RandomDan: I should get a frequent customer reward.
10:57 YClan: radon,   lol !
10:57 tmoney20g: i got a few toys r us ones to give out
10:58 tmoney20g: amzn should just buy sears
10:58 tmoney20g: then they can have amzn stores
10:59 YClan: Later guys... I gotta go put some cash into the credit union, and it's next door to an irish pub,so I might get derailed.
10:59 tmoney20g: then they can truely become "buy n large" from wall-e
11:00 radon224: I ordered my daughter a printer from AMZN.  Paid no shipping for "snail mail" shipping service.  Damned thing arrived the next day.  Crazy.
11:00 YClan: NFLX earnings are next week.
11:00 chenmann: later yclan
11:00 YClan: radon,  I know a lot of people who don't have prime, and don't pay for express shipping and get the item 1-2 days later...   I think the express shipping is a bogus upsell on AMZN.
11:01 radon224: yclan, agreed
11:01 chenmann: yep
11:02 radon224: I think if you order an item that's shipped by Amazon and not a third party, and you have a distribution warehouse near you....you are golden.
11:03 VolCrush: block chain a thing again?  RIOT from the depths of hell today
11:03 YClan: block chain smokers ?
11:04 JC_chart: so /es got down to 2755 , retraced and is down below midpointnext stop 2745 not sure if it goes there today as it could hang around midpoint for rest of day

11:04 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: today may not end well
11:04 JC_chart: however vix is getting bought so .... need to watch
11:05 YClan: Darryl,   play a short and make it a happy day
11:05 YClan: bye you all

11:09 tmoney20g: esmal any trades yet ?
11:10 radon224: Kudlow tryin to talk the market up
11:10 streetglide: is that a martini in his left hand?
11:10 chenmann: lol
11:11 chenmann: if it is its heavy
11:11 JC_chart: that guy is such a putz
11:12 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: he actually sounds drunk
11:12 JC_chart: sorry i should not have said that ... my appologies
11:12 tmoney20g: you know he's my uncle, right ?
11:12 tmoney20g: on my dad's side
11:13 mthfr_vaxxed: so if i start a public company and change my name to the next buzzword .... thats not any kind of SEC violoation ?
11:13 streetglide: nope
11:13 mthfr_vaxxed: or i guess he changed the business too.... i bet there never was a business....
11:14 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I'm glad he's working with Trump.
11:14 mthfr_vaxxed: the world of penny stock companies that aren't..... actually companies
11:14 JC_chart: hasha as i said my appologies
11:14 VolCrush: UNH p/b prob over done wit E = 10/16
11:14 streetglide: they might as well take it down to 46 while we are down here
11:15 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: If Qs can reverse over 173, rally might have legs.
11:15 VolCrush: this market reminds me of my last relationship, there are some serious TRUST issues running amuck
11:16 streetglide: yep
11:16 VolCrush: i don't think it gets legs if der fruit is below 220
11:16 JC_chart: well that's good you know that, will keep you safer
11:17 VolCrush: JPM is luking fugly, fur der dump
11:18 VolCrush: perhaps a Black Monday flush for capitulation
11:18 VolCrush: /rty she broke
11:21 VolCrush: yup, china names and some healthcare holdin bid
why in the hell would china names be bid?
11:21 RandomDan: I dunno Vol, could be.
11:22 RandomDan: I mean a black monday
11:22 AlphaInvestor: Vol - there was some Muchin chatter last night on china trade
11:22 RandomDan: Also China bid
11:22 AlphaInvestor: Munchin
11:22 RandomDan: China is oversold
11:23 chenmann: rotation??? out of us into china???
11:23 VolCrush: doubt dat, but could be
11:23 streetglide: no
11:24 VolCrush: i just find it interesting that on a relative basis that group is outperforming today
11:24 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: bear flag forming on Qs?    5m
11:24 AlphaInvestor: hoist the Beer flag
11:25 chenmann: rty broke 200dma first and never reclaim it on this up move, if rty is leading, we doom
11:25 streetglide: seema
11:25 chenmann: haha
11:25 VolCrush: max pain on der fruit 220 - 22.5
11:26 VolCrush: yah /rty is garbage
11:26 RandomDan: uncle Cramer tweeted yesterday that baba was worth more than it's price on a component basis. But he separately says don't buy China.
11:26 radon224: I believe China announced a new record trade surplus with the U.S. today, despite all of the sanctions.  May have something to do with it.
11:26 VolCrush: well chit if Cramer said that, i'm buying China
11:26 RandomDan: of course he tweeted this like 10 minutes after I sold my BABA
11:26 chenmann: ha
11:27 RandomDan: AH
11:27 chenmann: rty lod
11:27 RandomDan: so if BABA goes up, he told you it was cheap. if it tanks, he told you not to buy China. Win-win
11:28 radon224: /es gapfill has bulls rethinking things
11:28 VolCrush: midcap are broke as well
11:28 VolCrush: FANGS don't luk healthy either
------- Thursday, October 11, 2018 -------
17:29 AlphaInvestor: Vimes - likely not.
17:30 AlphaInvestor: An adaptation could be to use a user selectible mix of historic and implied volatiltiy
17:30 Vimes: i've always picked stocks outside my 401k but am intriqued by some of these factor models lately so just playing with them
17:32 Vimes: not sure links will stick:
https://logical-invest.com/universal-investment-strategy/
17:32 AlphaInvestor: AQR has a great paper on factor investing
Liquid Alt Ragnarok?
17:33 Vimes: yes i've started listening to some of their podcasts
17:33 Vimes: there is a good book for a novice like me :) by Berkin and Swedroe, called "Your complete guid to factor-based investing..."
17:34 Vimes: it is a very plain and simple summary of alot of the prior research
17:35 AlphaInvestor: Cliff Asness at AQR does a lot of that sumarizing too, but it can get kinda deep
17:35 Vimes: i worry alot on stat research though, because likely there is so much maniuplation of the data and screeneing etc. that you really don't know how they actually implement it in practice.  It seems these things never really play out in reall measured returns versus the backtest
17:36 AlphaInvestor: Vimes - a couple of my standard fundie screens are now Factor based, with custom Factor Tilts. Been using them for about a year and a half.
17:40 Vimes: do you use a service for that?
17:41 Nube: It isn't the fudging of the data that concerns me so much as something that worked well the last 20 years would be expected to not work well over the next 20
17:42 Vimes: that too, i'm not saying grad students are dishonest but at some point when you are trying to get published and get your phd you can talk yourself into throwing out all sorts of outliiers to make your model work
17:42 Nube: Sound, foundational factors probably not as bug of a concern, but a lot of the newer ones would concern me
17:43 Vimes: well the factors in the book i mentioned all pass the logic test for a solid investing plan so i believe the results, but as i've gotten older i'm more about not losing my money so don't want to experiment too much
17:45 AlphaInvestor: Vimes - I experiment with phantom portolios - my longest running is over 10 years old, I transfer what works to real $$
17:46 Vimes: i started investing with ibd and the fool nearly two decades ago, and both had a tilt to combination of technical and fundamental factors
17:46 Vimes: maybe more so ibd on the technical side
17:46 AlphaInvestor: example, everyone was big on Piotroski a while back. I implemented a phantom portolio that selected all the 8 and 9 rated stocks using Piotroski ... a big loser
17:47 Vimes: yes i've played with that as well using guru focus
17:47 AlphaInvestor: ran that succa for almost 5 years before giving it up because it Never outperformed
17:49 AlphaInvestor: Later Scripters
17:49 Vimes: later ai
17:50 JohnnyQuotron: later Alpha
17:50 MTS1: Not familiar or researched the P3 Squeeze Frank; so don't know what it is based on.
17:51 Vimes: i was curioius and looked it up on the tube, not sure its worth diverting a lot of time too unless someone is need of a direction
17:52 Vimes: looked to usee PPO and ADx, if not mistaken to time long entries when they pinch together
17:53 MTS1: Nube; what I've seen when DK executes it (in-out) he advocates taking profit at certain %, sooner (lower %) if it gets there quicker than expected. As I recall that was also what Mobius suggested the other day when he advocated for the strat.
17:54 Vimes: you would place the PPO chart above the ADX chart in the lower stack
17:54 MTS1: Letting it run to expiration applies to the Risk sidel if it does not go your way right away don't close it out.
17:57 Nube: I should have specified I was thinking specifically that ronco strat. I only ever said 1 to 1 which is not the same thing
17:59 Vimes: are they tracking the trades they have made - i always am a little skeptical on short dated options, i guess if there is a clear long trigger the premium should be really small so you aren't risking much
17:59 MTS1: I thought ronco was in-out; but I could have misundersood; was the first time I heard of it this week;)
18:00 JohnnyQuotron: Nube,, regarding DKs In and Out.  out at 50-55% profit assuming it is going your way.   never buy an in out before earnings that expires in the week or two after earnings.  more if you want it
18:01 Nube: I think it is an in and out, but I thought the purpose of it was to not manage it. You have ot have a heckuva win percentage to make a 1 to 1 work if you're punching out half the way done
18:01 MTS1: Not sure imes; I trust Mobius and DK, but don't have proof;)  DK might provide records when you're on his service, but I know he's a stats quant and has a reputation to uphold. 
18:02 MTS1: Nube; Mobius mentioned 80% as I recall; have to look back in teh archives for his rules.
18:02 JohnnyQuotron: the in out is a quant strategy.   
18:02 JohnnyQuotron: take the 55% and run.  
18:03 Nube: I think that was the ronco he was talking about. All 1 to 1's I dunno
18:03 JohnnyQuotron: in at no more than 1.03% of the spread between the long and short strikes
18:03 JohnnyQuotron: pleasedefine 1 to 1
18:05 JohnnyQuotron: 1 long call 1 short call on the bull side
18:05 JohnnyQuotron: 1 long put 1 short put on the bear side
18:05 JohnnyQuotron: prefers debit to credit spreads for in out
18:05 Nube: At 1 to 1 you would need mid 50s percent win just to break even. I can't imagine talking off a 1 to 1 at 50  based strictly on strike selection and not some other statistic.
18:07 Nube: 1 to 1 is risk : reward. Yes, an in out spread, most commonly 2 dollars wide at a cost of a buck
18:07 JohnnyQuotron: the theory is that with tight strikes and decent volatility and a 55% profit target the target will get hit alot.  (alot being a highly educated math term)
18:08 Nube: But 5 wide at 2.50 is where it will need to be on most stocks with a 3 digit handle
18:08 JohnnyQuotron: no hard stops EVER
18:09 Nube: Well, whether ronco only or all 1 to 1's I'm sure they have their numbers chosen for a reason
18:09 JohnnyQuotron: 10 with google... painful
18:11 Nube: Yea, but it would be a darned good hedge for a long tech position
18:12 MTS1: when you lose 50% before expiry you still have chance it goes to BE or profit. when u gain more than 50% and don't take it you have chance to lose it still. I'm not a Quant geak but that's how I understand it may work;) Especially if put on@extremes, reversion to mean trades
18:32 Nube: Sounds pretty quanty to me
19:04 MTS1: a good quant could explain it better if that is part of the edge; that's just how I wrap my simple brain around it in plain English. . Another side comment I heard DK make is that you won't usually get 100% profit unless both are ITM and you let them get assigned.
19:23 Nube: Make sure you're seating before you read the following. I'm serious. Sit. Down. Ready? the most stable currency in the world right now is Bitcoin
19:28 amalia: Boom!Haters
19:29 UpTheCreek: ummm is that before orafter the 10% it lost yesterday?
19:33 EvanBStock: DK does say if prob of touch on the long option falls below 45% to exit right then and yes take 55-65% target. Speaking of, if Dons In/Out Strat is 80% and thats assuming 50/50 odds (up or down) if I throw in a backtested strategy (based on TA) thats correct for any given time frame roughly 75%(+-5%) How would that change the probabilities or would it just make you profitable faster? Any ideas?
19:46 admin_tculs: thinkScript Lounge chatroom will be closing soon  Please finish all conversaions by 8pm ct   Have a nice evening
19:47 Paris: MTS - noticed some commentary on Ronco, you might like to check your chat log of 10.1.2018 where Mobius discussed that, where he also included some tos.mx links.
19:54 Nube: Good point, UTC. Yesterday was not smooth but in recent months it's been about as stable as most G7 currency pairs

06:46 harndog: Good morning
06:47 Vimes: gm
06:48 stevie_s: .
06:56 Nube: Morning all!
07:00 ZupDog: gm everyone.   have been trying to create a TTM Squeeze Label that will tell me when the squeeze is long, short, or in the squeeze.   The label script I came up should be showing RED now for the 30 min /ZN chart.  But instead is showing green.  Any help here would be appreciated.      http://tos.mx/JhHrlw#
07:03 Vimes: try this from the source:
# Squeeze watchlist column - Eric Purdy 2017
# http://tos.mx/Ruon09#
def sqz = !TTM_Squeeze().SqueezeAlert;
def direction = TTM_Squeeze()>TTM_Squeeze()[1];
def count = if sqz and !sqz[1] then 1 else count[1]+1;
def fired = if !sqz and sqz[1] then 1 else 0;
def firedCount = if fired then 1 else firedCount[1]+1;
def firedDirection = if fired then direction else firedDirection[1];
addLabel(yes, if sqz then "Squeeze:" + count else if sum(fired,5) then "Fired:" + firedCOunt + if firedDirection then " Long" else " Short" else "-", if sqz then color.red else if sum(fired,5) and firedDirection then color.green else color.orange);
07:04 ZupDog: Thanks Vimes.  Will give it a try.
07:16 Paris: upDog - replace the following snippet in your study
AddLabel( yes, if Hist > Hist[1] then "SqzHist Up "  else "SqzHist Down" ,
    if Hist > Hist[1] then Color.GREEN
    else if Hist < Hist[1] then Color.RED
    else Color.GRAY);
07:20 ZupDog: Thanks Paris.  Will do.
07:21 Paris: If that doesn't do it, I'm sure I have another study in my archives that does the label correctly.
07:26 Vimes: The one i posted seems to show the squeeze on /zn for 6 bars: so could be modiifed to your liking
 
07:26 Paris: ZupDog I have a version that counts the number of bars in consequtice squeezes as well. I've seen many squeeze studies being posted here in the last few years. Many ways to do this.
07:27 Paris: BBL, heading out for a late dinner
07:28 ZupDog: Vimes,  the one you provided works for displaying the squeeze, but does not show if the histogram has fired long or short.   I can still use this study though. Thanks for sharing it.
07:30 ZupDog: Looks like I may have to use two separate  label scripts. One for a long / short squeeze histogram and the one that Vimes provided. 
07:31 Vimes: once fired the label will be colored based on the direction
07:31 Vimes: green long orange short
07:34 ZupDog: Gottch.  Did not read the script close enough to pick up on that.  So the label you provided is just what I was looking for.  Thanks again.  Now let's see if I can modify that script to give a count for how many bars long /short.
07:35 ZupDog: Paris, thanks for your help also.
07:37 Vimes: for me the signal is more accurate on larger time frames, shorter time frames i think its pretty poor indicator
07:55 Mobius: The histogram in that study (TTM Squeeze) is a momentum indicator. The "Squeeze" signal is generated from Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channel. Ther's absolutly no statistacal evidence to show which direction a squeeze will ressolve, whether up or down in a near term. For the longer term the direction is slightly more likey to be a continuation of it's longer term trend.
07:56 Mobius: This study and the TTM Squeeze are identical

07:57 Mobius: And Purdy is not the originator of that study.
07:59 Vimes: ok - he generated the label
07:59 Vimes: didn't say the underlying study
07:59 Mobius: Labels for that study have been around at least 10 years I know of
08:00 Vimes: he's afilliated with that group of guys is all, just trying to attribute to the source
08:00 Mobius: John Bollinger is the source not the other guys either
08:01 ZupDog: Thanks Mobius.    Glad to see you made it thru the storm okay and are doing well.
08:02 Mobius: yw.. Not much of a storm here. But it sure wacked Panama City and Mexico Beach. I have family there and they're not even able to get back in yet
08:02 Vimes: Mobius, so you wouldn't attribute the use of keltner channels and bollinger bands to JC? it was in his book where i originaly saw it
08:03 Mobius: Vimes no!  There's a lot of books in trading where a lot of writers claim a lot of stuff the just isn't true. 
08:05 Vimes: "isn't true" meaning sobeody else proposed this as a measure, or "isn't true" meaning it just is rubbish and doesn't work?
08:05 Mobius: Neither Standared Deviation nor an Average Range nor the combination of the two was new in this or the last century.
08:06 Vimes: gotcha
08:06 ZupDog: We ate at Toucans in Mexico Beach years ago. Very nice place right on the water.  At least The Gibson Inn is still standing in Appalatchacola. Sorry to hear about your family's loss though.
08:07 woodie: junk is more like it
08:07 Vimes: lol
08:07 Mobius: lol  woodie
08:07 woodie: gm mobius
08:07 Mobius: gm.. glad to see your still kickin
08:08 woodie: thanks, glad your ok from storm too
08:08 Vimes: i'm not trying to defend it but seems like there are dozens of indicators that are all trying to measure consolidation as a heads up for the next potentail larger move (up or down)
08:08 Mobius: yeah  Still haven't tested my concrete bunker. But I'm happy to wait to do so  :)
08:09 woodie: great
08:10 woodie: if you want to see consolidation better..put heiken asli bars on chart look for group of small body candles..
08:11 Vimes: thx woodie, will take a look
08:11 Mobius: Vimes... In mathematics that the measure of linearity. There's already many algorithms that do that quite well. And, that's been an object for those that specialize in higher geometry for centuries. How to measure a series with as little data as possible to predict a future line.
08:12 Vimes: so if you would what would be the best leading indicator to measure, such a period, and trade its breakout on either side
08:12 woodie: cci
08:13 Mobius: You just stated the problem. The "breakout". There's nothing that proves a breakout will go any one direction. Reason - Market movement is random and any smaller aggregation.
08:14 woodie: mobius has some great stuff on his MYTRADE page
08:14 Vimes: no i get that, and that' sthe risk i'm comforatble taking in trading, i guess i'm just asking if you had to choose an indiator suite for such a thing what it woudl be
08:16 Mobius: I use a log price distribution drawn as a range while price compresses and trade after the breakout and retest of the area. I use my typical approach of knowing what I'm willing to risk to test the trade and when I'll make it a risk free trade if it goes my way. And, that study is on MyTrade already
08:17 Vimes: thx
08:17 Mobius: yw
08:20 woodie: a real good one is mobius cci gauassian with linear regression
08:20 Mobius: FYI - Any price compression study, Bollinger Band Width, ADX, Squeeze, Fractal Energy or any other can be traded the exact same way
08:21 Vimes: yep, i use risk off quite a bit, i need to be more dynamic about it but i typically just have a standard risk off target and then move to break even
08:22 AJayKC: #this label will show Earnings in days
def LastEarningsBar = AbsValue(GetEventOffset(Events.Earnings, 0));
def NextEarnings = if isNaN(LastEarningsBar) then 0 else LastEarningsBar;
addLabel(NextEarnings < 90 and NextEarnings > 0, "Earnings " + NextEarnings + " days", if NextEarnings <=3 then Color.light_Red else Color.gray);
08:23 AJayKC: hi quick question. this code is not properly working. it shows everything in Earnings in 1 days.
08:23 AJayKC: anything that needed to be adjusted with the code or i'm doing something wrong? help please.
08:24 Mobius:  Typical Squeeze. Drawn as a range on the price chart rather than just points. You can see the initial breakout was lower. That didn't hold and the channel was retested then there's a breakout up which is now failing. That is typical. Making the Squeeze just another area of Balance.
08:24 AJayKC: for example MSFT it says today is earnings. HEAR's earnings is november 1st but it says in 1 day.
08:25 MTS1: AJ; What aggregation are you running it at and how big is your expansion area?
08:25 AJayKC: i am using on daily chart max.
08:25 Vimes: thanks for the illustration mobius, very helpful, will try and find the study and look into it
08:25 UpTheCreek: ya gotta have enough exp area to actually see the earnings date
08:25 MTS1: No; there is no try. . . ;)
08:26 AJayKC: creek how i make sure of that?
08:26 Vimes: :) well there are lot of studies on his mytrade, if that was to me:) so have to find the matching one
08:26 UpTheCreek: ^^^ lol
08:26 Mobius: Vimes - That particular study is Squeeze Pivots
08:27 Vimes: cool, thanks, good discussion
08:27 mthfr_vaxxed: you can view earnings on the calendar. easier than seeing it on chart if its far out
08:27 UpTheCreek: chart settings, expansion area = whatever your criteria in the future is
08:27 AJayKC: ok thank you creek. i changed that and it seemed to work. i appreciate your help.
08:27 mthfr_vaxxed: marketwatch > calendar
08:28 AJayKC: also thank you MTS1.
08:28 UpTheCreek: yw
08:30 Mobius: And we're off
08:31 Nube: Where did the volume go the last couple of hours? it seemed fine all night and then it's like people just stopped trsding
08:31 Vimes: wow lag
08:32 chief: charts doa again
08:34 Wally: lag again like yesterday at open
08:42 mthfr_vaxxed: you make support ticket? sometimes devs dont know there is problem until its reported
08:45 chief: Yes.. Too many trsders doing too much trsding
08:49 tajtx: Mobius.   On one of your studies there is a notification of "Target Breached".   What does that mean?
08:50 JohnnyQuotron: Good Morning thinkScript Lounge...
08:52 MTS1: Taj; seems self explanatory?
08:52 MTS1: If you don't understand the target; find it in the script to understand.
08:53 tajtx: Could mean target to buy or target to sell?    I respect Mobius and want to make sure I understand the notification.    
08:54 JohnnyQuotron: Just to clarify, regarding the tos VWAP, when chat aggregation is set to 10 min and VWAP is set to daily, does the vwap calculation begin when the chart begins ?  Or does it begin at midnight?  Or does it begin at some other time?
08:54 JohnnyQuotron: chat = chart sorry
08:58 MTS1: Taj; yes. Don't think he knows either what indicator you're refering to; but typically I've seen them in a color indicating target buy / sell, and again if you read the code there may be further clues.
08:59 tajtx: I'll try and understand the code.    Thanks for the feedback.
08:59 MTS1: JQ; don't you see the median/sd lines re-set on the chart?
09:03 MTS1: On mine they restart when globex overnight starts at 6PM ET on futs
09:21 Paris: MTS - Just wanted to make sure you received that eml response, I had to send a couple of times due to formatting issues on my end
09:22 Paris: Signing out for the night, anything else you know where to ping me. Later MTS
09:52 JohnnyQuotron: I need some help with the addchartbubbles on this script  http://tos.mx/CeMzoE#
yes this is embarrassing.  i would really like the cyan bubble to paint on the first lower cyan dot and the orange bubble first lower orange dot
but i can't get the logic correct for the x-axis location  ...  if anyone can find the time later I would really appreciate the assistance
09:52 JohnnyQuotron: nite Paris
09:55 JohnnyQuotron: Mts.. looks like the openning of electronic trading at about 5:00 eastern? for \ES
09:55 RayK: Hi. My buffer is missing from room open to 7:47 EDT. Can someone please PB it to me? Thanks in  advance.
09:55 AlphaInvestor: The most important part of a bubbleMover script is the      showBubbles = NO input
09:56 JohnnyQuotron: ray the onenote is current
09:57 cajun: Ray, there was just a gm
09:58 JohnnyQuotron: alpha...i am not using that imput for the FE bubbles at the moment.  look down to around line 250.  sorry
09:59 JohnnyQuotron: mobius .. would you say your balance area held?
10:02 anees: hello everyone, can someone tell me where i can find the ATR filter in the scanner please
10:02 beta888: Hi, is there anyway to draw a line across the chart  that will follow current price of a stock?
10:03 Mobius: Johnny - here's the method to add those bubbles
addChartBubble(FE crosses below valueFElinear, -.1, "Linear", color.cyan, yes);
10:04 AlphaInvestor: Here is the way I did it:
addChartBubble( if pointslinear and isnan(pointslinear[1]) then 1 else 0 , -0.05, "Trend Exhaustion", pointslinear.takevaluecolor());
10:04 DMonkey: beta....
plot Data = highestall(if isnan(close[-1]) then close else double.nan);
10:05 Mobius: anees - Did you try under ATR?
10:07 Mobius: johnny - It's held so far. The day is young.
10:08 beta888: Thanks, i will try that
10:09 anees: hey Mobius, i dont find it, either im blind or im blind, does it even exist?
10:11 Mobius: Typical Bull Market Ends when there are New Lower Lows and Lower Highs first at the intraday levels then on the higher aggregations. So first indication of this Bull ending would be a price extension to within about 1% of the high and a failure to a new pivot low on the daily aggregation. We just had that. Now we look for another drive toward the high and a failure below the last attempt. Then another new low.
10:13 JohnnyQuotron: mobius.. regarding the bubbles.  I only want one of the first orange and cyan dot.  not on each cross.  thank you though.  I should have been more clear
10:13 Mobius: anees.  
Average(TrueRange(high, close, low), 10)
10:14 Mobius: First dot for the day, first dot for the chart?
10:14 JohnnyQuotron: first orange dot on the chart and first cyan dot on the chart
10:15 Mobius: the do a recursive count and take only the first in the count.
10:15 JohnnyQuotron: i dont know how to do that yet
10:16 AlphaInvestor: JQ - the code I posted plots at the first cyan dot of any new set of cyan dots
10:17 Mobius: def count = if FE crosses below valueFElinear
                     then count[1] + 1
                    else count[1];
addChartBubble(count == 1, ..........................)
10:18 JohnnyQuotron: mobius thank you.  Alpha sorry i didnt see the second post.  my apologies
10:24 ramesh2599: Mobis: could you pl post that code- Thanks----- Mobius: Vimes - That particular study is Squeeze Pivots
10:26 UpTheCreek: Ramesh, where does Mobius generally post his codes?
10:27 ramesh2599: I could not locate it:(
10:29 anees: thanks mobius, what im basically trying to do is find or make a filter that finds stocks that overextended 5-6 times their usual Range, can you advise please? thanks
10:30 mthfr_vaxxed: Johnny: you check the automated logs? now you dont have to worry about missing something! ....hopefully
10:31 Mobius: Johnny - before you drive yourself crazy - I should have indexed that count. Use this as your template
def count1 = if barNumber() > 1 and FE < valueFElinear
             then compoundValue(1, count1[1] + 1, 1)
             else count1[1];
addChartBubble(count1 == 1, 0, "Linear", color.cyan, yes);
10:31 NUG: Hey Mobius, do yo know if TOS is going to restore the drawings for continuous futures contracts any time soon (or at all)?
10:33 Mobius: anees - simple logic
TrueRange(high, close, low) > Average(TrueRange(high, close, low), 10) * 5
10:34 JohnnyQuotron: Mobius... thank you... i was driving myself crazy  But I was too embarassed to admit it.
10:35 Mobius: NUG - I'm not privy to any other information than what you or anyone else gets
10:36 ramesh2599: Mobi- I found it, Thanks
10:37 Mobius: sorry Johnny - One of the problems with codeing in the chat window.
10:37 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current.  BBL thank you all for the assistance !
10:37 Mobius: <<< To lazy to open the editor
10:39 JohnnyQuotron: Mobius.. thank you for setting me on the right path.  You as well alpha.  Maybe my next Padawan's guide should be recursive counting?   Oh my!
10:42 NUG: Mobius, thanks
10:43 anees: thank you so much Mobius
10:44 JohnnyQuotron: Oops.. someone forget to screw in their drain plug before thay put their 25-30 foot center console fishing boat in the water this morning.  Here comes the Coast Guard....
10:46 AlphaInvestor: JQkpa - I forgot to put mine in once on my 20 foot Yamaha - it has 5 plugs, I missed one. Go back to the boat launch, but not without considerable bailing and panic.
10:50 Nube: That's why I don't boat.
10:50 Nube: I'm not a details person
10:52 Vimes: its' good to have friends with boats
10:52 Nube: Also, we might be shaping up for interesting Sunday night. We aren't far from the 720 Mobius was watching.
10:58 MTS1: JQ; thought you were refering to the markets at first when you posted about someone forgetting the drain plug. .
10:59 MTS1: MTH; prefer logs with pictures; but nice to have an automated backup so that's appreciated!
11:11 JohnnyQuotron: mth... update me on the automated log thingy again please..
11:14 UpTheCreek: in his mytrade
11:17 mthfr_vaxxed: yup. got a script running that sends logs out to github. updates logs locally every 10 min. sends to github every 2 hours during weekdays
11:18 mthfr_vaxxed: but yea....no pictures... yet
11:24 JohnnyQuotron: mth... excellent work  how does your app send to github?  can the app email?
11:27 JohnnyQuotron: Oops the crane barge is going to be too late... the Center Console is beneath the waves
11:28 JohnnyQuotron: and the SPY is not looking much better
11:28 Nube: Analogy for Europe's markets today.
11:29 AlphaInvestor: hopefully not your center console JQkpa
11:31 mthfr_vaxxed: just python script. does a `git add && git push` bash command.
11:31 mthfr_vaxxed: and you could script up email .... but then your working backwords. revision control is where the cool kids hang out
11:33 MTS1: JQ in Linux is what MTH is saying also, if you're familiar with that.
11:33 mthfr_vaxxed: yeah. microsoft just got a bash prompt last year i think so you can be cool too
11:34 mthfr_vaxxed: and linux got powershell i think? that one confuses me.
11:35 UpTheCreek: lol
11:32 tmoney20g: i missed seema

11:35 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: did I say something wrong?
11:37 tmoney20g: perhaps
11:37 tmoney20g: i do that, once a day
11:38 tmoney20g: tculs beats me with a stick
11:38 vipin123: hi
11:38 vipin123: how can I  move the trendline in thinkorswim
11:38 vipin123: guys how much commision are you paying for each trade here. 10$ is slightly high, is it negotiable?
11:39 streetglide: click on it
11:39 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: what does censored mean?
11:39 AlphaInvestor: You cannot move the trendline, the price moves the trendine ...
11:40 vipin123: I want  to move it parallely
11:40 AlphaInvestor: Darryl - that means yoiu posted something bad, don't do it again
11:40 AlphaInvestor: Vip - use a price channel then
11:40 vipin123: how
11:41 JC_chart: its  not too hard, it is one of your drawing tools
11:41 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I didn't know complimenting someone on TV was bad.
11:42 JC_chart: find that tool .. thenmaybe go to stock charts and look at what it is and how you create them that is probably easiest wya
11:42 AlphaInvestor: Darryl - was it market related?
11:42 tmoney20g: tculs runs a tight ship here
11:42 chenmann: o man, i c bear flags every where.....
11:43 tmoney20g: lots of shoulda coulda this week
11:43 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: not really except she was on cnbc earlier.
11:43 mthfr_vaxxed: is the sky falling after all ?
11:43 SPYOPTS: Dow is negative
11:43 vipin123: chineese taking all the money back home

11:44 tajtx: Wow.   
11:45 JabbaTheCabin: nice little selloff we're havign
11:47 tajtx: Went to all cash last Thursday.   Think I'll stay there until possibly next week.
11:47 AlphaInvestor: DING - bot some SH ... hedging at least a part of my portolio
11:48 tajtx: Thinking about the same Al.
11:52 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I had a mental price target of 171 on Qs.  It hit.
11:53 tmoney20g: little baby rebound here
11:54 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Q's bounce off 200 day
11:55 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: computer buys triggered
11:55 JC_chart: looking at my spy and vxx xharts ... there soes seem like there could be a bounce but needs to cross above 373 and change and then hold on spy thn target would be 273.62 or short vxx which confirms
11:58 JC_chart: yeah sppy i smarching up to that resistance line at 273.50
11:59 JC_chart: they are selling that level so maybe just a retracement and another leg down  need to wait a few bars to see what chart says
12:03 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Would be shocked if no bounce here, at least to recover 50% of losses over last week
12:04 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: 3 marching soldiers on Qs
12:05 jsher: DIRV
12:06 VolCrush: 3 marching soldiers, not sure i've ever heard that before
is that like 3 praying nuns?
12:06 fred__w: darryl  its unlikely there would be a bounce like that  not yet  anyway
12:07 fred__w: ..imo  of course  but  we'll see
12:07 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: candelstick term.  sposed to be bullish for trend.
12:07 JabbaTheCabin: 3 marching soldiers? why not 4 horsemen of the apocalypse?
12:07 VolCrush: welp this bounce is being offered by AAPL, AMZN & MSFT, fwiw
12:08 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Some japanese guy named it not me :)
12:09 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: means bulls winning.
12:09 radon224: My chart shows 4 calling birds, 3 french hens, and two turtle doves....and it's not even Christmas time yet!
12:10 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: lol
12:10 JabbaTheCabin: no cristmas carols before thanksgiving. And no playing "stairway to heaven" in music stores.

15:01 tmoney20g: how'd you make money on nq ?
15:01 VolCrush: no she didn't she said we'd get there, we did 
15:01 fred__w: based on a prior years turn  we will likely see a fight for a while  whenever the real bottom is in  so  there should be more low test(s)  nevertheless  we'll see
15:02 Eedie: Hmmm well I agree with you but she corrected me
15:02 VolCrush: huh, when?

15:05 VolCrush: VRTX* as well
15:05 blondetrader: so as of now any move higher is a correction w/in the htf bear
15:05 blondetrader: es would have to break 2805ish
15:05 RandomFamily: well today was helpful, still down for the week tho.
15:05 VolCrush: TEAM* is another
15:06 fred__w: bt  that basically what im saying too
15:06 blondetrader: if es is to run the whole move lower tg =2650-40
15:06 RandomFamily: I agree with you both. I would call this a relief rally, no more.
15:07 blondetrader: and it was poop
15:07 blondetrader: we may see cont weakness thru oct
15:07 RandomFamily: it helped me get out of positions I needed to get out of, my risk profile is much better now.
15:07 blondetrader: rty made ll and lh
15:08 AlphaInvestor: serious damage on the Weekly and Monthly /ES chart
15:08 blondetrader: as long as 1595 holds as res 1485 tgt lower
15:08 blondetrader: yes
15:09 fred__w: since there was a 5th consec green and trending candles  the mkt is starting to to show a bit more strength
15:09 fred__w: 15min wise
15:10 VolCrush: TLRY* HAD a nice move on the close
15:10 king: hey sell tweeter now
15:10 RandomFamily: I am also more set to move on Monday if I even think I smell a selloff.
15:10 fred__w: ..doesnt mean we're done bu any means
15:11 invertedhammer: Hi bt you think rty brings. Es,nq with it lower?
15:11 blondetrader: ya this was weak all things concidered

15:12 blondetrader: yes Hammer
15:12 fred__w: invert  all mkts are related  
15:12 blondetrader: today was bad for rty
15:12 fred__w: bt  bad is relative  :)
15:13 AlphaInvestor: long a call on ATHN ... not proud of that trade
15:13 blondetrader: on the bright side for rty
15:13 blondetrader: next weeks lower weekly
15:14 blondetrader: will be the 5th week of price testing and or exceeding weekly low range
15:14 AlphaInvestor: ATHN is a Merger Arb, but only got half the trade filled
15:14 RandomDan: No idea about next week.
15:14 blondetrader: fwiw I have never seen it go thru 5
15:14 fred__w: i for one  will be tpushing back a bit from here  
15:14 blondetrader: so that said
15:14 invertedhammer: Ty bt respect your input
15:14 blondetrader: if for some reason we got that 1485 Id buyit
15:14 fred__w: ..be that up or down
15:14 VolCrush: actually i tot the tape on ATHN was purty gud today
15:15 VolCrush: kinda curious, y don't u like the trade?
15:15 fred__w: vol  if you are tot down  why trade b4 indices show strength?
15:16 fred__w: top*
15:16 VolCrush: top down in terms of macros, global
15:16 AlphaInvestor: news was that offers would be above 135 ... so I did a long call at 135, while trying to leg in a short call at 140 to partially pay for it (assuming that the 140 wouldn't be hit)
15:16 RandomDan: I thought the day was good.
15:17 RandomDan: the dip in the middle was great
15:17 fred__w: vol  hmmm  i dont see it  but  everyones different
15:17 Kooldenny: So glad I brought MMNFF last week!
15:17 AlphaInvestor: Vol - the 140 never got filled, so I paid full price for the 135 long call
15:17 VolCrush: @fred not sure i understand your question
15:18 VolCrush: i tink you will like that call, Alpha..... E coming up
15:18 tmoney20g: kooldenny, this room is for tickers less than or equal to 4
15:18 RandomDan: Al you should be able to complete it on Monday
15:18 VolCrush: not sure when u hit but if it was today, it's a gud trade
15:18 fred__w: vol  my topdown indicator is my index price  and even if that showed something  i have no strong leaders left
15:19 fred__w: ..above 11ema
15:19 VolCrush: ah, i luke at currencies, bonds, oil, global markets and then luk at catalyst within individual names
15:19 fred__w: vol  ok  i c
15:20 AlphaInvestor: Dan - I sure will try, but I don't like that it is lonely out there for the weekend
15:20 fred__w: time for weekend crunching  later dudes
15:21 VolCrush: Alpha the only bad part is the long call is so far OTM, but the chart luks like a pop into E
15:21 blondetrader: bye fred
15:21 VolCrush: cheers fred
15:21 AlphaInvestor: Yeah, lonely out there I wanted it to be a lower cost spread. If I was going to do a lone long call, it would be ATM or ITM
15:21 RandomDan: Al it will go out for drinks and make new friends, don't worry
15:21 AlphaInvestor: That is exactly the part I don't like
15:22 RandomDan: lol
15:22 AlphaInvestor: Dan - I sure hope so, I hope one of those friends offers to take it back and consumate a Merger of Equals
15:22 fred__w: i am totally jazzed for the future
15:23 VolCrush: so bronx, don't u owe us something?
15:23 RandomDan: I think the market is set to go sideways, newsflow dependent.
15:24 blondetrader: lol
15:24 blondetrader: we didnt open 2780 so I only owe it to u
15:25 AlphaInvestor: So, WFC which missed E is up 1.3% today ... but JPM that beat E is down 1.09% today. What kinda bizarro world do we live in.
15:26 VolCrush: ok, i'll wait patiently for the "ping" on my phone
any second now, right?
15:26 blondetrader: keep watching for it
15:26 JC_chart: cuirious on rty trade
15:26 RandomDan: It's my fault Al. Fins going up as soon as I take a loss on my GS.
15:26 JC_chart: mind sharing your entry and exit and chart timeframe
15:26 RandomDan: but I don't feel like doing that
15:26 VolCrush: welp you Alpha, more than anyone here know that funnies don't mean chit with respect to how the market reacts
ergo, drop funnies
LOL
15:27 JC_chart: totally ok if you say no... just interested
15:27 VolCrush: i figured bronx, never keep your word....typical w

15:28 blondetrader: this was not the day I expected
15:28 blondetrader: haha no
15:28 JC_chart: did you hold it thru last night?
15:28 blondetrader: I did
15:28 blondetrader: and got stopped out this am
15:28 JC_chart: holy s**
15:28 JC_chart: that's a big stop LOL
15:29 blondetrader: no lol I made $$
15:29 RandomDan: bt, really. This is exactly the day I expected... using your TA!
15:29 JC_chart: i am sure you did
15:29 JC_chart: u were short right
15:29 AlphaInvestor: Vol - with both reporting the same day, they should have reacted in relation to their E results
15:29 blondetrader: :)
15:29 JC_chart: as of yesterday afternoon
15:29 blondetrader: no i was long into this am
15:29 VolCrush: welp send me a pic wearing red soled only then...........
15:29 JC_chart: ohhh i thought you were short
15:29 VolCrush: Alpha, they did
15:29 JC_chart: it went up 25 points
15:29 blondetrader: nooo I was on for the rally pffft
15:29 blondetrader: I was looking for 95 lol
15:30 RandomDan: she was long, I remember
15:30 JC_chart: what tiemframe do you use to identify entries
15:30 blondetrader: 4 hr mostly
15:30 blondetrader: and dly
15:30 RandomDan: so what about the day didn't go as you expected?
15:30 blondetrader: well Dan I thought the pop would have more teeth
15:30 blondetrader: this was like a little kitten
15:30 blondetrader: not a lion
15:31 RandomDan: I thought it was pretty good, considering the wreckage.
15:31 blondetrader: I would not be surprised to see another wave of selling monday am b4 we get any consecutive days of green
15:31 blondetrader: dissapointing
15:32 blondetrader: but i have some scary tgts lower
15:32 RandomDan: the day was a big cup, also a positive.
15:32 blondetrader: so to avoid mkt need to do some work
15:32 VolCrush: not a bad pop actually, only because the close was vary gud on /nq
so respectfully disagree
15:32 blondetrader: nq could rally another 100
15:32 blondetrader: and still look like shit
15:32 VolCrush: or more
15:33 blondetrader: btw that would be res for leg 2
15:33 blondetrader: anything over........we good
15:33 VolCrush: well we wanna buy chit, who wants to buy gud?
15:33 blondetrader: lol yes but if nq fails that
15:33 blondetrader: you can buy it a lot cheaper
15:33 VolCrush: sell against
15:34 blondetrader: like to the tune of67s
15:34 VolCrush: true but we got pick our lines in der sand
15:34 blondetrader: figure 150 off this weeks low would be next tgt dn
15:34 blondetrader: well nq needs to hold 7112
15:34 VolCrush: i gots my names for hunting season and will fall on my sword if necessary
15:34 JC_chart: we could have some violent upswing no doubt in the indexes but I think insitutions need market to drop more so they can buy it and bid it back up like they do in every cycle
15:35 blondetrader: yes
15:35 AlphaInvestor: I think this past couple days was selling der MoMo and a rotation into Quality. MSFT, ADBE and such did very well for me when those trades were put in this week during the downturn
15:35 blondetrader: as i mentioned we have a htf bear move happening that isnt complete momo wise
15:35 blondetrader: and we have a dly oversold
15:35 VolCrush: heck i wanted 6845 on /nq, when i called 7 k /nq i got laffed out of here 
15:35 blondetrader: so would make sense to get some relif
15:35 JC_chart: yeah 6800 is the midpoint for nq for a 1Y daily chart
15:36 VolCrush: ah hah, ty @JC
15:36 JC_chart: honestly all that matters is AMZN
15:37 JC_chart: so we should just trade that as it makes up what percent of NQ ... 60 haha
15:37 VolCrush: emmmm, der fruit is a playa and mr softie is now relevant for some reason
15:37 blondetrader: 1835 needs to break amzn
15:37 blondetrader: orr 1621 lol
15:38 blondetrader: rty closed red today
15:38 blondetrader: no bueno
15:38 VolCrush: either way lots of resistance with every pop now
15:38 JC_chart: RTY is very sick on my chart
15:38 VolCrush: yah true dat, rty is a big problem atm
15:39 blondetrader: honesly
15:39 VolCrush: yes dear
15:39 blondetrader: if it has to rinse like to get it done this month
15:39 JC_chart: it trendline has been down since 9/24 and the pitch of that line is steep not much releif soon unless earning are rocking
15:39 blondetrader: like before last week of oct
15:39 VolCrush: welp u wanna see a down trend line go see XLF
15:40 blondetrader: it made a lower low today lol
15:40 JC_chart: youre right it is sicker
15:40 blondetrader: and it leads imo
15:40 blondetrader: this turned 1-2 weeks b4 the others gave it up
15:41 JC_chart: so any of you ever traded wheat futures or soybeans?
15:41 blondetrader: yep
15:42 JC_chart: you know they have nive moves in the morning
15:42 blondetrader: I do :)
15:42 Bid_Ask: what's nive
15:42 JC_chart: and they are super volatile but i was thinking i almost like them better than es
15:42 blondetrader: for sun night mon am i am really leaning on selling rty
15:42 JC_chart: you have the same payout
15:42 blondetrader: they offer minis
15:43 blondetrader: imo the trend is more true in ags
15:43 JC_chart: i was sitting in soybeans yesterday and forgot about the monthlyr eport and it ripped about 5 dollars in a nano second
15:43 blondetrader: yea got to mind those report
15:44 JC_chart: i was lucky i was long it also whipped back so i did fine but yes that was my thought exactly when i  sold the contracts LOL
15:44 blondetrader: lol
15:45 JC_chart: when you speak of trend you are speaking of trend on daily right?
15:45 blondetrader: genericly yes
15:45 blondetrader: but I prefer when all time frames are in agreement
15:46 JC_chart: me too ibut i try to just focus on one chart
15:46 JC_chart: i look at the daily 30m for trend
15:46 JC_chart: and then trade the 3 or 1m
15:46 blondetrader: oh yea thats too small for me
15:46 JC_chart: i built some indicaotrs that are multitimeframe so that helps just using one chart
15:46 fred__w: jc  i use 3 charts for context  1yr-mo 3mo-wk 14da-da
15:47 fred__w: and look for >11ema
15:47 JC_chart: im happy with a 10 tick move on cl or gc moer is great but i am greatful for that
15:47 JC_chart: im not an ema fan
15:47 fred__w: jc  i do that to build probability
15:48 JC_chart: but i get why you use it so please dont misunderstand my intent
15:48 fred__w: jc  the particular method is not criotical  i was giving you a variation of bt's stmt
15:49 blondetrader: :)
15:49 blondetrader: I have errands......see you guys sund night
15:49 JC_chart: appreciat that
15:49 JC_chart: have a good weekend
15:53 Eedie: Bye all
