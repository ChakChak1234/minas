16:31 Anonymous so far: What do y&aposall think about SQ tomorrow? Down?
16:31 VolCrush: *histograms
16:31 JC_chart: i do actually sometimes but not in that image
16:31 VolCrush: i tink SQ has lost all or most of their top shelf managers, apparently der CEO is an arse
16:32 JC_chart: in that image I am showing two different histograms one driven on breadth and volume and one driven on price
16:32 VolCrush: wats the delta rthen from one histo to the other?
16:32 VolCrush: ah ok
16:32 JC_chart: the move
16:32 JC_chart: or momentum
16:33 JC_chart: but here let me do a fib one so you dont think i am bsing you one sec
16:33 VolCrush: momentum in volume? volume and breadth?
16:33 VolCrush: btw, you should be able to post the chart directly in here 
16:33 JC_chart: yes as a raw input that is transformed by the indicator
16:38 JC_chart: this is one of the GC trades i did
16:38 JC_chart: i tried to post it right in here but gave me a bad size
16:39 JC_chart: the entry was at one fib and exit at another
16:39 VolCrush: got it, thanks
16:40 JC_chart: my sq chart says it is flat lined in a range so hard to tell what will happen tomorrow
16:40 admin_tculs: JC  please do not post outside links here
16:41 JC_chart: well how do you post an image in her admin_TCULS
16:41 VolCrush: s/he is tryin to post the TOS chart in here, but I and others don't know how to do that
16:44 AlphaInvestor: JC - make your chart smaller before clippping - I use WinDoze 10 Snipping Tool. Then past into the chat box, right click and Zoom to 10%. Then hit send
16:45 VolCrush: ty, Alpha
16:45 JC_chart: how small
16:45 VolCrush: 10%
16:45 Gus: can't wait until eveything can be shorted with ease
16:46 AlphaInvestor: 640 x 640 I believe, but not sure
16:46 VolCrush: LOL, shorting for the last 3 days has been as easy as it gets
16:47 Gus: anybody a strictly short saler here?
16:47 VolCrush: or what, Alpha said
16:47 JC_chart: k
16:48 Gus: also yeah, but the consistency of being able to short all the time so not just 3 days lol
16:48 JC_chart: been able to short gold for a long time LOL
16:49 Gus: yes yes for sure but easier lol, i guess I'm not on the JC_chart level yet haha
16:49 AlphaInvestor: Gus - you can short most liquid things, those that are NTB or HTB, you can often go Synthetic Short via options
16:50 AlphaInvestor: Sell an ATM call, buy an ATM put - viola ... you are synthetic short stock
16:50 Gus: only have 18k and ive shorted $SUPV $MDXG $INNT & $BFR easy plays but as i get better I don't want to implode from lok
16:50 AlphaInvestor: I have a couple Call Credit Spreads on BFR -- bearish play
16:51 Gus: yeah i got out of it awhile back but thinking of heading back in soon
16:51 VolCrush: i tink he a penny scalper
16:52 Gus: not all the time haha but percentages are huge on plays like that
16:52 Gus: bfr went down like 15% in the last week, i shorted $SUPV instead and got 7% before it reversed and now its down another 7% since i left
16:53 AlphaInvestor: Vol - ah, CCS too commish intensive for penny scalping
16:53 AlphaInvestor: SUPV doesn't trade options, I cannot be short in my IRA
16:53 Gus: h&s pattern with a terrible downtrend on those stocks is a consistent play that I've made but don't wait long enough to realize
16:53 Gus: the best gainz
16:54 Gus: also, laugh if you'd like, ive never touched options haha
16:55 Gus: just basic shorting and longing, mostly shorting, as im better at that.
16:58 JC_chart: wow TOS sure does make it hard for you
16:58 VolCrush: chit bronx, AH moves e.g. AMZN*
16:59 JC_chart:  
16:59 JC_chart: OMG did that work
16:59 JC_chart: so vol that was an NVDA trade i took
17:00 JC_chart: entered when histos and trend line were green at the bottom of the range fib and exited at the 23.6
17:01 VolCrush: DAMN u did it, way to persevere
17:01 JC_chart: i am not sure if that was more frustrating or when the time and sales stopped today on gc LOL
17:07 AlphaInvestor: you missed the part about right clicking and scaling down to 10%
17:08 AlphaInvestor: That way you can post a slightly bigger chart, scaled down so it doesn't burn so much buffer
17:08 RandomDan: I am back.
17:09 AlphaInvestor: whew
17:10 RandomDan: I see I shouldn't have sold BABA
17:11 408Spartan: Any idea how to enable After Hours/ Pre Market prices for the tickers in MarketWatch?
17:12 JC_chart: I am not sure how to scale it down on my mac actually

17:28 chenmannmobile: yes bt
17:29 chenmannmobile: if good , up we go
17:30 AlphaInvestor: BT - yes, I posted the banks that are reporting earlier
17:30 chenmannmobile: nflx er 16th al
17:31 NullTrader: Hi I have a study that was created by my own code. I was able to edit it before. Now when I right click it, it only shows a "calculator" but no code to edit. What did I do wrong?

17:31 blondetrader: well fingers crossed
17:31 blondetrader: from these prices the long would be so much more awesome
17:34 408Spartan: JC_chart can you post a s creenshot of what youre seeing? I couldnt find it.
17:36 JC_chart: what im seeing  for what?
17:36 408Spartan: the Setting youre talking bout
17:36 VolCrush: meh, meh
17:37 RandomDan: gap up tomorrow becoming more plausible
17:37 chenmannmobile: buy baba back dan
17:37 chenmannmobile: ah
17:37 408Spartan: Apparently you cant or so says Support "Hello! Sorry about the wait. Afterhours prices you will look at the bid and ask."
17:38 VolCrush: pics from bronx, becoming a 98% probibility with IV of 2%
17:38 AlphaInvestor: 408 - wrong!!
17:38 AlphaInvestor: But support don't know diddly some times
17:38 JC_chart: im short gc at 1227
17:38 amalia: Buy /YM
17:38 RandomDan: too late, sold at 141.90
17:39 RandomDan: I am not buying back at a loss
17:39 JC_chart: target is 1226. but might not get there on 1st try
17:39 408Spartan: AlphaInvestor thats what I thought i mean its a pretty simple utility just goddamn hard to find tht Setting
17:39 AlphaInvestor: 408 - add a new custom column - I named mine myLast ... put a single word inside    CLOSE   ... set the aggregation to 1 minute using the little box that defaults to D (daily)
17:39 RandomDan: I am long plenty of other stuff
17:40 amalia: 61 t trail
17:41 blondetrader: gc drop to 20
17:41 JC_chart: 404spart do you see the gear in your tooldbar header a
17:41 JC_chart: haha
17:41 AlphaInvestor:  
17:41 JC_chart: im hoping that for you with rty
17:41 blondetrader: and tomorrow if below that 1213
17:41 RandomDan: JC I think you will make money short gc
17:41 AlphaInvestor: 408 - also, make sure you click the box for EXT hours
17:42 AlphaInvestor: right click that post, zoom up to 100%
17:42 blondetrader: will prob do gc short tomorrow
17:42 amalia: P shape from 24,893
17:42 amalia: Intraday
17:43 VolCrush: i noticed the move in /gc today, kinda scratched myself but the $$$$ did dip a bit; inflation worries all over
17:43 JC_chart: I dont know  gc hit 126.6 5 times now  and my chart is now  has conflict
17:43 VolCrush: listening to the Grateful Dead eating pistachio ice cream
who, who has it better than us?
17:44 AlphaInvestor: NOBODY
17:44 JC_chart: i think it was the shorts covering after  the hbid up last night and early this morning and some hedging too
17:45 RandomDan: gc was just a fear play IMHO, fear be dissipating. It's not a good inflation hedge even if inflation actually became a thingm
17:45 AlphaInvestor: Timberland is a great inflation hedge! And I know just the guy ...
17:45 JC_chart: dont disagree but the market players become irrational on days like to day so....
17:46 RandomDan: yeah but if the market rises tomorrow, gc goes back to sleep
17:47 JC_chart: ya know GC has always a few great day trades every day
17:47 RandomDan: I don't really follow it. It's just on my watchlist for context.
17:48 JC_chart: and if youre right, it will march back to 1165 or so and that could be a good bit of trading to there
17:48 JC_chart: i like trading cl too but sometimes it is just too   whiphot and wicky candles so i trade gc
17:49 AlphaInvestor: Well, it was real today. Later Traders
17:49 JC_chart: I dont like es as i it is expensive and actually doesnt have that many great moves except when a plunge happens
17:49 RandomDan: No idea. I think it's going to hang around 1200, but no reasoning behind that.
17:49 chenmannmobile: later al
17:49 RandomDan: later Al
17:49 VolCrush: /cl is the most news driven product out there, to trade /cl you must follow the news on /cl and global macros
17:50 RandomDan: the mood in the room is different tonight. yesterday most of us were shell shocked
17:50 JC_chart: I just follow my chart for cl
17:50 JC_chart: when things agree and there is a fib range go in
17:50 JC_chart: there are usually 10 or so trades a day on the 3m
17:51 RandomDan: cl... I have no edge at all. Would never try it.
17:51 JC_chart: my charts have the edge
17:51 RandomDan: I don't know how many tankers are parked wherever... how many rigs this and that.
17:52 JC_chart: don't really give a you know what ... my chart indicators agree there i is a trade i take it as i beleive in my charts
17:53 JC_chart: not saying that with any obnoxiousness just saying that is the truth
17:53 chenmannmobile: i only trade cl during war
17:53 chenmannmobile: any war
17:53 RandomDan: Whatever works for you man.
17:53 JC_chart: i lost a lot of money  disagreeing with my chart and not beleiveing in my system ... once i paid attention and trusted my system its been great
17:53 RandomDan: war, charts, loaded dice
17:55 chenmannmobile: cnbc special, was today s flush the bottom?
17:55 RandomDan: 
17:56 blondetrader: ugh
17:57 RandomDan: my sense, and take it for what its worth, is tomorrow is big bounce #1, but I have no idea if it will hold (or even happen, just the voice in my head)
17:58 chenmannmobile: did fill that gap es 2713, and bounced right off
17:58 RandomDan: Also, while I am playing a clairvoyant trader on TV, I would look for GOOG close to 1120
17:59 RandomDan: 1115 maybe. Something like that.
18:00 VolCrush: welp, if CNBS said that, we have 500 points more to the downside   
18:00 RandomDan: Of course ERs could be awful and the whole house of cards goes to the floor.
18:00 VolCrush: or short the gap up, LOL
18:00 RandomDan: What are those fine folks saying?
18:01 VolCrush: or read the *ucking tape
18:01 chenmannmobile: "it s time to nibble" cramer
18:01 VolCrush: i would never much less take a bite out of Cramer
18:01 VolCrush: *I would never nibble...
18:01 RandomDan: Cramer would be good if he didn't push his book so much.
18:01 VolCrush: really is he tasty
18:02 VolCrush: ??
18:02 RandomDan: I like the guy. It's like having an uncle who's a used car salesman.
18:03 VolCrush: you shouldn't refer to Marcos that way
18:04 RandomDan: I wouldn't buy a car from him but I like the stories.
18:05 chenmannmobile: o wow futures up lot....so far

18:32 amalia: Hoping polarity stays positive
18:32 tmoney20g: so that's almost 100 pts since 3pm
18:36 amalia: Yep. #TeamWideStops ftw
18:36 amalia: And for the losses. haha
18:40 EasyE: I just need SPY to open at 288 and I'll be done.

06:47 Deep: Big dips always comes in threes. Get ready
06:49 Eedie: My numbers are way off on GC.  I show 19-21 as support and 27 as target higher.  So I'm staying away because I'm way off target compared to your numbers..
06:50 Eedie: I think I'm staying with es and rty.
06:50 Eedie: However, silver looks interesting.
06:51 blondetrader: ohhh I havent looked at that in a long while

07:53 Vimes: not a tax guy, but i would guess at your nomral tax rate
07:53 blondetrader: you can prob goog it
07:53 Regretfulflyer: I’ve tried it’s not Exactly easy to understand
07:54 blondetrader: hold on
07:54 blondetrader: it is 50% of the gain at your current tax rate
07:55 Regretfulflyer: Thanks
07:55 blondetrader: ur welcome wow canada actually lower cap gain overall that us 
07:55 blondetrader: thats the only rate lower but nice'
07:55 AlphaInvestor: I get taxes withheld on lots of ADRs from lots of countries. I don't keep track, it's a cost of doin' biz
07:56 Regretfulflyer: So 50% of my dividends are withheld so I can tell the IRS to give me more because I took a loss
07:56 tmoney20g: hi hi
07:57 streetglide: O Canada......our home and native land
07:57 Regretfulflyer: Can we buy into the ASX, and the British stock market?
07:57 blondetrader: your taxed on 50% of the gain
07:57 Regretfulflyer: Gain is dividends yes?
07:58 blondetrader: yes if the div was 100 you r taxed on 50.00
07:58 blondetrader: not sure about how much loss can be offset
07:58 Regretfulflyer: Talk about a kick below the belt in taxes ouch
07:58 blondetrader: but i think it would wash
07:59 blondetrader: well we r taxed on 100% of our gains so
07:59 Regretfulflyer: Does the UK and AUS have banks on the NYSE that offer dividends?
08:00 blondetrader: that I do not know
08:00 tmoney20g: someone's gotta pay for all that maple syrup
08:00 tmoney20g: esmal, whatcha eyeing ?
08:00 Eedie: LOL tmoney
08:01 tmoney20g: o yay, it worked.
08:01 tmoney20g: i have trailstop for options
08:01 Regretfulflyer: Someone talked to us at the local 145 plumbers union about stocks this year I’m the only one who made a portfolio and self managing it. Were told diversify in other countries but safely in banks
08:01 dug03: @Regret... don't forget USA gives a foreign tax credit amongst all that mess, I never paid attention,, neither urgent nor important to figure out
08:02 Eedie: Ok  anybody have BABA?
08:02 streetglide: Good for you Regret...good luck with it
08:02 dug03: I know it cost me more tx with SAN, than it did with ITUB
08:03 blondetrader: I do
08:03 blondetrader: pcs
08:03 Regretfulflyer: Why I’m trying to figure out how to buy into the UK and AUS and CAN
08:03 tmoney20g: buy a house in each country
08:03 tmoney20g: then you'll live everywhere
08:03 Regretfulflyer: ....that’s more money than I have atm
08:03 tmoney20g: oh
08:04 tmoney20g: i feel your pain
08:04 Regretfulflyer: Think my total invested in is $2k
08:04 john: Good morning all! Woke up with MU going up?
08:04 tmoney20g: i have 3 houses in 1 place
08:04 tmoney20g: instead of 1 house in 3 places
08:04 lilFish: does anyone know the trick to making earningscast play?
08:04 Regretfulflyer: Can I has a house?
08:05 AlphaInvestor: Tmoney - if you are using a Stop with options, then you don't understand options
08:05 blondetrader: omg ya dont do that
08:05 Regretfulflyer: ??
08:06 john: Alph- you said the stock I bot with my strategy was bad. But I made 400$
08:07 Eedie: Wtg on BABA BT
08:07 Regretfulflyer: I don’t day trade it’s like Russian roulette too risky
08:08 Regretfulflyer: Plus warren buffet says the $$$ is in long holding for dividends so did JP Morgan
08:09 Regretfulflyer: Does anyone know a better REIT than O, or STAG?
08:09 john: Yeah, I am starting to notice the long hold is better
08:11 Regretfulflyer: Only profitable REIT I found in Canada is SHAW but is there any under 5% yield but pays well?
08:11 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Casino almost open!
08:11 Regretfulflyer: Profitable
08:12 tmoney20g: paddle wheel casino ?
08:12 tmoney20g: are you in the ozarks ?
08:13 Regretfulflyer: Colorado
08:13 streetglide: Ozark is a good show
08:13 lilFish: hi street - love Ozark
08:13 streetglide: hey
08:14 Regretfulflyer: What is Ozark?
08:14 lilFish: show on netflix
08:14 Paul: If a company buys back half it's stock, does the obligation to the dividend remain the same on the repurchased shares?
08:14 Regretfulflyer: Ah, then no I can’t afford Netflix I’m buying stocks instead
08:15 streetglide: a company is not going to pay itself on those repurchased shares
08:16 streetglide: everyone else still gets their same divy
08:16 Paul: so that would mean it's retained earnings
08:16 Paul: would rise.
08:16 Regretfulflyer: Is there a REIT in the UK that’s on the NYSE? Under 5% yield but profitable?
08:17 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I think Paul is asking if the rermaining shares are required to be paid a dividend.  The answer is yes, but the board makes those declarations and can change it.
08:18 Paul: Excellent.
08:20 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Dividends are great, but I would not hold a stock in a downtrend just to get the dividend.  That's just me.
08:20 Regretfulflyer: Buffet does and selling in a down trend you’re throwing money down the toilet
08:21 streetglide: actually dividends reduce retained earnings, btw
08:21 lilFish: so noone here listens to conference calls on earningscast?
08:22 Regretfulflyer: No WiFi at my apartment only cell phone so nope
08:23 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I can't argue with what you said, Regret, that is what Buffet does.   But like I said, it's just me.  I like to buy stocks into momentum,  not bottom fish....most of the time anyway.
08:23 streetglide: you can probably go to JPM site and get a recording, fish
08:24 lilFish: yea - i was hoping this would be one convenient place to listen to all of them and not have to give my email to every corporate site I'm interested in listening to
08:24 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Lil, not me.  The Big Fish pay big money to get that info about 15 seconds before the little fish, so it's already moving before we get the info.  
08:24 G3_: you can go to the company website, get the phone # five mins beffore conference call begins.  As a last resort 
08:24 G3_: beat me to it Street
08:24 Regretfulflyer: I’m trying to find banks and reits in the UK that offer dividends. Google says 15m searches found. The pages don’t offer information
08:25 lilFish: thx -that sounds like a good option
08:25 fred__w: important gap shows in an app i have  suggesting a halfway pt
08:26 fred__w: but  as always  play the tape
08:26 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: they pay millions to get that info before everyone else.  
08:26 Regretfulflyer: Why do y’all want to listen to a boring conference call
08:26 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: amazon has rebounded 80 bucks
08:27 tmoney20g: @esmal what you gonna do
08:27 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: scuse me 75
08:27 Regretfulflyer: And it cost $2k to buy nope
08:27 Regretfulflyer: I’d rather buy LMT cheaper and more dividends
08:28 Regretfulflyer: Dividend
08:29 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: LMT earnings on 10/23
08:30 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: may have a lot of stocks bounce off their 200 day averages today
08:31 Regretfulflyer: Question? Does France have banks listed on the nyse?
08:32 thetiderider777: chart lags badly again today
08:33 Regretfulflyer: I’m hungry I’m going to eat breakfast nice talking to y’all ^_~>
08:34 unasol: has anyone found a better alternative to TOS, with decent indicators?
08:34 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: SQ had dropped over 30% from its high, and still has not touched its 200 day
08:35 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: after a gap up now they'er selling SQ
08:35 fred__w: ibelieve i dodged a bullet with this open  now at even strength
08:36 radon224: nasty chart lag, again
08:37 JC_chart: GM
08:37 fred__w: radon  i suggest learning to trade with prices extant  do the chart stuff prior  just a suggestion
08:37 RandomFamily: good morning
08:37 JC_chart: BT if you are still in RTY i am impressed on your ability to weather a ride
08:37 JC_chart: but it is paying short now
08:38 radon224: I use "something else" to get my quotes fred
08:38 JC_chart: GC cant decide what it wants to do alot of conflict on my chart
08:38 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: CNBC sure is trying to talk up the markets.  "Russell 2000 has now exited it's correction".
08:38 JC_chart: im long 221 aapl calls
08:39 ranchman: team
08:39 fred__w: rad  nice
08:39 fred__w: darryl  there can be another test
08:40 ranchman: team  I have $2500 in my "cash & sweep vehicle" but is not in my  "option buying power fund".  Why?  I deposited two days ago?  help...
08:40 michael9844: whats going on with TOS and lagging charts
08:41 michael9844: Pretty sad for such a large and well known platform
08:41 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Anybody else spot the Qs selling at the open even though it gapped?  Looked like pretty good downside volume
08:41 fred__w: ranch  you have to play with that  its not obvious  at least it wasnt for me  how to tell if cash is settled
08:42 fred__w: ..there is a way tho
08:42 fred__w: ..cash avail for withdrawal is key
08:42 fred__w: imo
08:42 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Td settles way faster than Scottrade did that's for sure.
08:43 ranchman: so I guess it takes more than two days?
08:44 tmoney20g: over night for options, could be T+2 for equities
08:44 tmoney20g: the trade desk would know better answers
08:44 4205: Not the only one who has a lagging chart, right?
08:44 Chappy: Good day all. Is anyone else getting massive chart lag?
08:45 tmoney20g: yes, everyone will have it at the open, too much traffic
08:45 Anonymous so far: yep second day this has happened
08:45 4205: Yup. Thats unfortunate
08:45 pietro: Why is the chart lagging?
08:45 michael9259: yes. second day for me
08:45 Chappy: crappers
08:45 michael9259: prophet is working correctly it seems but....
08:46 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: opinions on GDX?  Looks like breakout yesterday, pulling back today.  I've been burned on this one before!
08:46 fred__w: daryl  yes  a day   it seems
08:47 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Chart lag is bc everything you think is happening today actually happened yesterday ;)
08:47 fred__w: unless we test lows  im done for the day  i think
08:48 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Already fred?  You cashed in some calls?
08:49 fred__w: darryl  i went long prematurely  and balanced at the open  gratefully  the mkt gapped up
08:50 michael0093: in a surprising twist... my tos is running fine... unlike yestrerday, active trader not synched with charts or level 2.  try unplugging the modem for a minute.
08:50 JC_chart: out of aapl long, waiting for /GC to get out of its range... I would wait on GDX too it is in a stair step down move but gold hasnt made up its mind yet today, my charts look more choppy than anything else on gold
08:50 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: k, thanks GC
08:50 fred__w: darryl  i accomplished my goal tho
08:50 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: cool
08:51 fred__w: ..and thx to the gap up  with minimal damage
08:51 AlphaInvestor: Til Ray
08:52 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: yeah, GDX is pulling back from overbought yesterday outside BB's
08:52 Dimka: Jeez, everything green except my holdings
08:52 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I know the feeling dimka!   
08:53 AlphaInvestor: DING - closed HPQ short call for a penny
08:53 fred__w: darryl  in position trading  relative long short holdings is key
08:54 featherweight: I believe I can fly
08:55 featherweight: I believe I can touch the sky
08:55 featherweight: I think about spooz every night and day
08:55 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I'm the boy plunger  :)
08:56 JC_chart: market makers just got sick of waiting on gold and threw a big whack of cash to push it down lets see if it will stay and if it does gdx will follow
08:56 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: That refers to Jesse Livermore btw  :)
08:56 tmoney20g: just tested the TRAILSTOPLIMT
08:56 Thlinx: I still see the QQQ going lower
08:56 fred__w: darryl  yes  i know
08:56 tmoney20g: it worked, but i had it set too narrow of a trail
08:57 tmoney20g: gonna be a learning curve here
08:57 Bealzybub: ACRX trading halted ahead of FDA meeting..........
08:58 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Once bitten, twice shy on miners.  Actually more than once bitten.
08:59 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Miners are literally near the bottom 5 of 200 sectors in Investors Business daily.  
09:00 JC_chart: I dont disagree but there are many great day trades in miners and gold futures with the right setups
09:00 streetglide: I cant ever seem to time the miners etf's worth a chit
09:00 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: might've went up a little yesterday.  Have not checked.
09:00 JC_chart: just day trades
09:01 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Me neither Street, but I think that's bc they have been on a downtrend, so rebound breakouts get hammered
09:02 streetglide: a lot tof times they dont follow gc all that well intraday
09:02 JC_chart: the gold futures actually are better to trade
09:02 blondetrader: am short gc
09:02 blondetrader: 23.5
09:02 JC_chart: hard to make money on options with gdx
09:02 JC_chart: yep im short from 1224.7
09:03 JC_chart: crossed  the midpoint target is 1222.8
09:04 JC_chart: and im out at 1222.7
09:04 JC_chart: so u never coulda got that move with options on gdx ,, but u can with futures
