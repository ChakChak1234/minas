16:31 Anonymous so far: What do y&aposall think about SQ tomorrow? Down?
16:31 VolCrush: *histograms
16:31 JC_chart: i do actually sometimes but not in that image
16:31 VolCrush: i tink SQ has lost all or most of their top shelf managers, apparently der CEO is an arse
16:32 JC_chart: in that image I am showing two different histograms one driven on breadth and volume and one driven on price
16:32 VolCrush: wats the delta rthen from one histo to the other?
16:32 VolCrush: ah ok
16:32 JC_chart: the move
16:32 JC_chart: or momentum
16:33 JC_chart: but here let me do a fib one so you dont think i am bsing you one sec
16:33 VolCrush: momentum in volume? volume and breadth?
16:33 VolCrush: btw, you should be able to post the chart directly in here 
16:33 JC_chart: yes as a raw input that is transformed by the indicator
16:38 JC_chart: this is one of the GC trades i did
16:38 JC_chart: i tried to post it right in here but gave me a bad size
16:39 JC_chart: the entry was at one fib and exit at another
16:39 VolCrush: got it, thanks
16:40 JC_chart: my sq chart says it is flat lined in a range so hard to tell what will happen tomorrow
16:40 admin_tculs: JC  please do not post outside links here
16:41 JC_chart: well how do you post an image in her admin_TCULS
16:41 VolCrush: s/he is tryin to post the TOS chart in here, but I and others don't know how to do that
16:44 AlphaInvestor: JC - make your chart smaller before clippping - I use WinDoze 10 Snipping Tool. Then past into the chat box, right click and Zoom to 10%. Then hit send
16:45 VolCrush: ty, Alpha
16:45 JC_chart: how small
16:45 VolCrush: 10%
16:45 Gus: can't wait until eveything can be shorted with ease
16:46 AlphaInvestor: 640 x 640 I believe, but not sure
16:46 VolCrush: LOL, shorting for the last 3 days has been as easy as it gets
16:47 Gus: anybody a strictly short saler here?
16:47 VolCrush: or what, Alpha said
16:47 JC_chart: k
16:48 Gus: also yeah, but the consistency of being able to short all the time so not just 3 days lol
16:48 JC_chart: been able to short gold for a long time LOL
16:49 Gus: yes yes for sure but easier lol, i guess I'm not on the JC_chart level yet haha
16:49 AlphaInvestor: Gus - you can short most liquid things, those that are NTB or HTB, you can often go Synthetic Short via options
16:50 AlphaInvestor: Sell an ATM call, buy an ATM put - viola ... you are synthetic short stock
16:50 Gus: only have 18k and ive shorted $SUPV $MDXG $INNT & $BFR easy plays but as i get better I don't want to implode from lok
16:50 AlphaInvestor: I have a couple Call Credit Spreads on BFR -- bearish play
16:51 Gus: yeah i got out of it awhile back but thinking of heading back in soon
16:51 VolCrush: i tink he a penny scalper
16:52 Gus: not all the time haha but percentages are huge on plays like that
16:52 Gus: bfr went down like 15% in the last week, i shorted $SUPV instead and got 7% before it reversed and now its down another 7% since i left
16:53 AlphaInvestor: Vol - ah, CCS too commish intensive for penny scalping
16:53 AlphaInvestor: SUPV doesn't trade options, I cannot be short in my IRA
16:53 Gus: h&s pattern with a terrible downtrend on those stocks is a consistent play that I've made but don't wait long enough to realize
16:53 Gus: the best gainz
16:54 Gus: also, laugh if you'd like, ive never touched options haha
16:55 Gus: just basic shorting and longing, mostly shorting, as im better at that.
16:58 JC_chart: wow TOS sure does make it hard for you
16:58 VolCrush: chit bronx, AH moves e.g. AMZN*
16:59 JC_chart:  
16:59 JC_chart: OMG did that work
16:59 JC_chart: so vol that was an NVDA trade i took
17:00 JC_chart: entered when histos and trend line were green at the bottom of the range fib and exited at the 23.6
17:01 VolCrush: DAMN u did it, way to persevere
17:01 JC_chart: i am not sure if that was more frustrating or when the time and sales stopped today on gc LOL
17:07 AlphaInvestor: you missed the part about right clicking and scaling down to 10%
17:08 AlphaInvestor: That way you can post a slightly bigger chart, scaled down so it doesn't burn so much buffer
17:08 RandomDan: I am back.
17:09 AlphaInvestor: whew
17:10 RandomDan: I see I shouldn't have sold BABA
17:11 408Spartan: Any idea how to enable After Hours/ Pre Market prices for the tickers in MarketWatch?
17:12 JC_chart: I am not sure how to scale it down on my mac actually

17:29 chenmannmobile: if good , up we go
17:30 AlphaInvestor: BT - yes, I posted the banks that are reporting earlier
17:30 chenmannmobile: nflx er 16th al
17:31 NullTrader: Hi I have a study that was created by my own code. I was able to edit it before. Now when I right click it, it only shows a "calculator" but no code to edit. What did I do wrong?

17:31 blondetrader: well fingers crossed
17:31 blondetrader: from these prices the long would be so much more awesome
17:34 408Spartan: JC_chart can you post a s creenshot of what youre seeing? I couldnt find it.
17:36 JC_chart: what im seeing  for what?
17:36 408Spartan: the Setting youre talking bout
17:36 VolCrush: meh, meh
17:37 RandomDan: gap up tomorrow becoming more plausible
17:37 chenmannmobile: buy baba back dan
17:37 chenmannmobile: ah
17:37 408Spartan: Apparently you cant or so says Support "Hello! Sorry about the wait. Afterhours prices you will look at the bid and ask."
17:38 VolCrush: pics from bronx, becoming a 98% probibility with IV of 2%
17:38 AlphaInvestor: 408 - wrong!!
17:38 AlphaInvestor: But support don't know diddly some times
17:38 JC_chart: im short gc at 1227
17:38 amalia: Buy /YM
17:38 RandomDan: too late, sold at 141.90
17:39 RandomDan: I am not buying back at a loss
17:39 JC_chart: target is 1226. but might not get there on 1st try
17:39 408Spartan: AlphaInvestor thats what I thought i mean its a pretty simple utility just goddamn hard to find tht Setting
17:39 AlphaInvestor: 408 - add a new custom column - I named mine myLast ... put a single word inside    CLOSE   ... set the aggregation to 1 minute using the little box that defaults to D (daily)
17:39 RandomDan: I am long plenty of other stuff
17:40 amalia: 61 t trail
17:41 blondetrader: gc drop to 20
17:41 JC_chart: 404spart do you see the gear in your tooldbar header a
17:41 JC_chart: haha
17:41 AlphaInvestor:  
17:41 JC_chart: im hoping that for you with rty
17:41 blondetrader: and tomorrow if below that 1213
17:41 RandomDan: JC I think you will make money short gc
17:41 AlphaInvestor: 408 - also, make sure you click the box for EXT hours
17:42 AlphaInvestor: right click that post, zoom up to 100%
17:42 blondetrader: will prob do gc short tomorrow
17:42 amalia: P shape from 24,893
17:42 amalia: Intraday
17:43 VolCrush: i noticed the move in /gc today, kinda scratched myself but the $$$$ did dip a bit; inflation worries all over
17:43 JC_chart: I dont know  gc hit 126.6 5 times now  and my chart is now  has conflict
17:43 VolCrush: listening to the Grateful Dead eating pistachio ice cream
who, who has it better than us?
17:44 AlphaInvestor: NOBODY
17:44 JC_chart: i think it was the shorts covering after  the hbid up last night and early this morning and some hedging too
17:45 RandomDan: gc was just a fear play IMHO, fear be dissipating. It's not a good inflation hedge even if inflation actually became a thingm
17:45 AlphaInvestor: Timberland is a great inflation hedge! And I know just the guy ...
17:45 JC_chart: dont disagree but the market players become irrational on days like to day so....
17:46 RandomDan: yeah but if the market rises tomorrow, gc goes back to sleep
17:47 JC_chart: ya know GC has always a few great day trades every day
17:47 RandomDan: I don't really follow it. It's just on my watchlist for context.
17:48 JC_chart: and if youre right, it will march back to 1165 or so and that could be a good bit of trading to there
17:48 JC_chart: i like trading cl too but sometimes it is just too   whiphot and wicky candles so i trade gc
17:49 AlphaInvestor: Well, it was real today. Later Traders
17:49 JC_chart: I dont like es as i it is expensive and actually doesnt have that many great moves except when a plunge happens
17:49 RandomDan: No idea. I think it's going to hang around 1200, but no reasoning behind that.
17:49 chenmannmobile: later al
17:49 RandomDan: later Al
17:49 VolCrush: /cl is the most news driven product out there, to trade /cl you must follow the news on /cl and global macros
17:50 RandomDan: the mood in the room is different tonight. yesterday most of us were shell shocked
17:50 JC_chart: I just follow my chart for cl
17:50 JC_chart: when things agree and there is a fib range go in
17:50 JC_chart: there are usually 10 or so trades a day on the 3m
17:51 RandomDan: cl... I have no edge at all. Would never try it.
17:51 JC_chart: my charts have the edge
17:51 RandomDan: I don't know how many tankers are parked wherever... how many rigs this and that.
17:52 JC_chart: don't really give a you know what ... my chart indicators agree there i is a trade i take it as i beleive in my charts
17:53 JC_chart: not saying that with any obnoxiousness just saying that is the truth
17:53 chenmannmobile: i only trade cl during war
17:53 chenmannmobile: any war
17:53 RandomDan: Whatever works for you man.
17:53 JC_chart: i lost a lot of money  disagreeing with my chart and not beleiveing in my system ... once i paid attention and trusted my system its been great
17:53 RandomDan: war, charts, loaded dice
17:55 chenmannmobile: cnbc special, was today s flush the bottom?
17:55 RandomDan: 
17:56 blondetrader: ugh
17:57 RandomDan: my sense, and take it for what its worth, is tomorrow is big bounce #1, but I have no idea if it will hold (or even happen, just the voice in my head)
17:58 chenmannmobile: did fill that gap es 2713, and bounced right off
17:58 RandomDan: Also, while I am playing a clairvoyant trader on TV, I would look for GOOG close to 1120
17:59 RandomDan: 1115 maybe. Something like that.
18:00 VolCrush: welp, if CNBS said that, we have 500 points more to the downside   
18:00 RandomDan: Of course ERs could be awful and the whole house of cards goes to the floor.
18:00 VolCrush: or short the gap up, LOL
18:00 RandomDan: What are those fine folks saying?
18:01 VolCrush: or read the *ucking tape
18:01 chenmannmobile: "it s time to nibble" cramer
18:01 VolCrush: i would never much less take a bite out of Cramer
18:01 VolCrush: *I would never nibble...
18:01 RandomDan: Cramer would be good if he didn't push his book so much.
18:01 VolCrush: really is he tasty
18:02 VolCrush: ??
18:02 RandomDan: I like the guy. It's like having an uncle who's a used car salesman.
18:03 VolCrush: you shouldn't refer to Marcos that way
18:04 RandomDan: I wouldn't buy a car from him but I like the stories.
18:05 chenmannmobile: o wow futures up lot....so far

18:32 amalia: Hoping polarity stays positive
18:32 tmoney20g: so that's almost 100 pts since 3pm
18:36 amalia: Yep. #TeamWideStops ftw
18:36 amalia: And for the losses. haha
18:40 EasyE: I just need SPY to open at 288 and I'll be done.
