15:30 TnT: anywho, have a good weekend
15:30 blondetrader: bye AL
15:30 AlphaInvestor: Laters
15:30 RandomDan: bye Al
15:30 VolCrush: i'd be happy to cut off all imports from China, product sucks and is poorly made

the average american will be crushed but at least they'll have a job: production
15:31 RandomDan: blonde, just not seeing a deal
15:31 VolCrush: cheers, Alpha
15:31 blondetrader: maybe I am too optimistic
15:31 TnT: indeed
15:32 blondetrader: but if I am right each of you has to send me candy
15:32 TnT: that would be a big win for the peeps that Xi does not want in power
15:32 blondetrader: :)
15:32 VolCrush: i'll send u red soled shoes
15:32 blondetrader: haha
15:32 RandomDan: Vol, just about all IT equipment is mafe in China now. And the quality is exactly what the manufactrers will pay for.
15:33 TnT: and includes spy chips in the servers
15:33 blondetrader: lol
15:33 VolCrush: yah, and for that they get the IT.........ah, vary bad deal, @dan
15:33 blondetrader: thats too funny
15:33 VolCrush: sorry IP
15:33 TnT: funny but true, huge security issues
15:34 VolCrush: it's the IP that is horrid
15:34 blondetrader: oh I know it
15:34 RandomDan: I don't disagree
15:34 TnT: including gov computers and servers that handle other classified material
15:34 blondetrader: but this is what we have become bc of bad deals
15:34 TnT: YES
15:34 VolCrush: once they have all the IP, they compete, cut prices and the USA is *ucked, just bad biz
15:35 blondetrader: sometimes a little pain is good in the long run
15:35 VolCrush: chit, they just made a fighter plane based on blue prints stolen from th US
15:36 RandomDan: My point is that the industry wanted this. They lobbied hard.
15:36 blondetrader: wanted what
15:36 RandomDan: Same with H1B.
15:36 VolCrush: yah, cuz of wages
15:36 TnT: this admin realized there were chinese surveillance cameras that were purchased and installed on military bases.  They kinda put an end to that
15:36 VolCrush: and Uniouns, which have killed America
15:36 RandomDan: Wanted to outsource to China.
15:37 VolCrush: Unions were set up to save children from labor
15:37 TnT: Vol, it was really tax incentives for big companies to off shore manufacturing and other jobs
15:37 VolCrush: way back in der industrial age
15:37 blondetrader: oh right u r dan
15:37 VolCrush: Unions????? ah no
15:38 VolCrush: outsource cuz of unions, cut cost
15:38 VolCrush: simple
15:38 VolCrush: basic economics
15:38 RandomDan: unions by themselves are not a problem. Germany has larger, more powerful unions and their manufacturing rocks
15:38 TnT: that is part of it
15:38 VolCrush: cuz everything here is union
15:38 TnT: all very complex
15:39 TnT: in any case, the US is now improving
15:39 VolCrush: in Germany they don't pay for school or medicine totally diff issue
15:39 VolCrush: and they pay a higher tax %
15:39 TnT: I'm gone, all enjoy
15:39 VolCrush: not comparable
15:40 VolCrush: cheers TnT
15:42 VolCrush: it's like all the cos that outsourced their call center over seas, no one could understand them and nothing was done correctly....total cluster *uck, but it saved money for the cos.......consumer, not so much
15:42 blondetrader: oh and how
15:43 RandomDan: just saying... these are multiple factor problems. Not good to oversimplify or blame one thing.
15:43 VolCrush: all part of cost, unions...etc
15:43 VolCrush: who is over simpilfying?
15:43 VolCrush: it is a wholistic issue
15:44 blondetrader: I dont know enough about all this
15:44 RandomDan: "unions killed America"
15:44 VolCrush: yah, they have
15:44 VolCrush: unions were set up for child labor laws
15:45 blondetrader: but I see we have big things happening
15:45 VolCrush: during the industrial revolution
15:45 blondetrader: and imo will be good for makret
15:45 admin_tculs: Again   please keep commentary civil and market related
15:45 blondetrader: at least for 1/2 of 2019
15:45 RandomDan: Vol, do comps with other countries. Less union labor in US than in more competitive countries.
15:47 VolCrush: nope, that's not were our labor is going, it's going to countries with little to no labor laws
you are simply wrong, with all due respect
we knew wat we were doing (CEO's) and now we have to solve the problem we created
15:47 VolCrush: for example why ever buy something made by NKE
15:49 VolCrush: we are talking to 2 diff issues, you are talking about labor in the US
i'm talking about products consumed by US but made outside of the US, wat > 60% of crap
2 diff issues
15:49 RandomDan: also, America isn't dead.
15:50 VolCrush: no , but while i didn't vote for him DT, does want to change the land scape on multiple dimension.....that i agree with
15:51 RandomDan: I did not vote for DT but I do favor his stance with China, though not his style.
15:51 VolCrush: welp, on dat we agree
15:52 RandomDan: I just think we need to remember that "China" includes for example Tim Cook.
15:52 VolCrush: there's a reason i've been a registered Indy for over 30 years, LOL
15:53 VolCrush: yah even the fruit got reeemed for labor practices overseas, just like NKE
15:53 RandomDan: At work I found an old PowerMac G5. Made in the USA. I felt like crap.
15:54 VolCrush: keep it, it's an antique and worth mula!!
15:54 RandomDan: It was from the early 2000's, not that long ago. It was perfectly possible.
15:55 RandomDan: I should have grabbed it.
15:56 yoz: Ok.. so I think I understand.. going back to one of my main rules.. never be in aftermarket.. I thought these Canadian tickers shut down for trading after the bell, but I guess there's activity TOS doesn't capture?  Market value says 6.32  on MMNFF now but the last candle says 5.99... in other words, never be in after market ever even on pink slip OTC stocks.. 
15:58 VolCrush: ok good chatting @dan and all, i respect everyone's opinion and everyone has a voice, from which we will all make our own trading plan
have a gud weekend
@admin_tculs enjoy your weekend
15:58 blondetrader: see ya W

08:49 tmoney20g: bt, back to retest 7185 ?
08:50 tmoney20g: nope
08:50 blondetrader: the push lower i do not think is done
08:50 tmoney20g: back to retest 7140
08:50 blondetrader: but if right 71 should hold as res
08:50 21sa: Will spy hold 200 ma
08:50 blondetrader: magic 8ball says no

08:51 tmoney20g: too screwy right now
08:51 AlphaInvestor: /RTY outperforming. You think RTY leads BT, don't you  think that is a good sign right now?
08:51 blondetrader: out performing rn
08:51 blondetrader: overall blech
08:52 tmoney20g: bt, low low test point ?
08:52 tmoney20g: after 7120 is broken ?
08:53 blondetrader: 7070
08:53 AlphaInvestor: yeah, it has underperformed since I put some IWM on

08:54 blondetrader: ya
08:54 21sa: Blond what is 7070-7040
08:54 tmoney20g: nq test points
08:54 invertedhammer: 7100 next push
08:56 fred__w: well well well  another week
08:56 blondetrader: dynamics wise it would be better for us if mkts went to lower tgts first and used the last of oct to rally
08:56 fred__w: ..lets see a test right away  shall we?
08:57 blondetrader: if it rally first cont weakness into nov would be expected
08:57 blondetrader: would be nice
08:58 AlphaInvestor: test? Test? TEST? nobody said there was going to be a TEST!
08:58 tmoney20g: test on friday
08:58 tmoney20g: study all week
08:58 radon224: Barring some major opportunity, I'm waiting until after midterm elections to deploy heavy long.
08:58 fred__w: h31  gm
08:58 fred__w: oops
08:59 blondetrader: if we get those nlows I am going in :)
08:59 fred__w: bt  theres where we differ  of course
09:00 blondetrader: EW peeps think perhaps we see cont weakness into Q1-2 of 2019
09:00 blondetrader: I dissagree atm
09:00 fred__w: ..yes  i c
09:00 blondetrader: but all that matters for now is where this drop completes
09:00 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: ADBE wants to test 40 week line again.  Cramer favorite
09:01 invertedhammer: Watching. Rty 50 possible add. Short
09:01 blondetrader: they are correct to think it bc theoreticly price is very far from 2018/19 balance
09:01 aa: why MU dropping again . is there no bottom for it. bought big position at 61
09:02 fred__w: ..of course  however  our models differ significantly there
09:02 blondetrader: what does ur say
09:03 fred__w: bt  another substantial drop
09:03 radon224: my model is round, black, and has a big 8 on it
09:03 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: MU looks headed for 37.50
09:03 AlphaInvestor: ADBE^ - I got some of that, but if it is a Cramer fave ... I need to rethink
09:04 invertedhammer: Es hesitation fri low
09:04 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: cramer mentioned it last week i think it was.
09:05 cocodog: gm
09:05 blondetrader: fred even more than what I anticpate?
09:05 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: did they split MU?
09:05 cocodog: no school today
09:05 fred__w: bt  not exactly sure  bcuz we cite different indices  but  they will rhyme
09:06 fred__w: ..mine is technically a derivative
09:06 blondetrader: well we in same direction :)
09:07 blondetrader: es 52 gets taken 45 next
09:07 fred__w: ..yes  like that
09:07 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: MSFT looks like breaking out of bear flag
09:07 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: down that is
09:08 fred__w: ..and the timing doesnt have to be immediate  but is likely to be in the near future
09:09 fred__w: ..it is only a model tho  we have to see  of course
09:09 tanker: gm
09:09 radon224: /es S1 2753, ONL is 2750
------- Saturday, October 20, 2018 -------
15:45 Grasul: def LL = Lowest(low,9);
def NewLow = if low == LL then 1 else Double.NaN;
#def ReferenceHigh = if NewLow == 1 then high
#    else if high > ReferenceHigh then high 
#    else ReferenceHigh[1];
#def BullCounter = if NewLow == 1 then 0 
#    else if high > ReferenceHigh then BullCounter[1]+1 
#    else BullCounter[1];
15:46 Grasul: minus the commenting of course, I can't firgure out why ReferenceHigh doesn't ever seem to have a value
15:46 Grasul: if I plot ReferenceHigh I get nothing
15:47 JohnnyQuotron: But if you are like me and you look at Gaussian RSI Laguerre as the primary indicator but TMO and Gaussian SMA Crossovers then having a little quick and dirty profit calc on each lower study is reassuring.
15:56 Nube: grasul, make your reference high tow variables. The first being the high at the ll and the next being for highs above that. Doing that will let you see where the problem is.
15:56 Grasul: ok, thank you
15:58 JohnnyQuotron: trying to self-assign a non initialized rec...   do you have a little ! on your chart?
16:01 JohnnyQuotron: grasul.. please post the fix as I need to learn how to fix that error as well
16:09 Grasul: will do
16:30 amalia: Look at Renko study for example
16:41 MTS1: JQ; I think you can click on the ! to figure out the cause.
16:46 Grasul: I figured out my issue. The line that read def ReferenceHigh = if NewLow == 1 then 0 else if high > "ReferenceHigh" then high else ReferenceHigh[1];
16:47 Grasul: The ReferenceHigh in quotes needs to be ReferenceHigh[1], it can't test against itself, it needs to test against the previous bar
16:48 MTS1: makes sense; good feeling you found it right?
16:49 Grasul: I don't know about you guys, I consider myself pretty decent at logic chains, but in my coding, its almost always a logic issue
16:50 Grasul: (once you know the basic syntax)
16:50 Grasul: squishing bugs is always a good feeling past the initital frustration
16:50 MTS1: so it is for trading, plus human psycology..
16:51 MTS1: In scripting helps to know how to debug to see the values you're working with. Or breaking down statemetns smaller to see if the final statement is correct logic.
16:52 Grasul: yah, I code for at least part of my job for a living (though SQL, not this) so I get lots of practice squishing bugs.  The human part of trading, testing against yourself and figuring what makes yourself tick are for sure the interesting and challenging part.
16:54 Grasul: in this language, you do so much of the work in the variable definition, I think I'm just going to start by plotting almost all of my variables as I write the code and then remove the variable plots I don't care about once I'm sure they're getting the right answers.  It seems like the best way to debug.
16:56 MTS1: That probably gets cumbersome once you're somewhat familiar with the syntax, plus you cannot plot recursive variables that reference themselves. But yes that is the right way to debug; if there are many variables I'll debug a section at a time though. (and add plot statements for recursive variables that can easily be commented out again).
16:57 Grasul: that makes sense, I appreciate the help

18:42 UpTheCreek: guess that's what you call a simple script  ;)
18:51 cajun: Vimes, thankyou for post... interesting measures in there, like minimum negative excursion on winning trades.  i looked back at the july buffer you referenced, i see only few comments on gaps. 
18:51 cajun: could you say more about it
18:55 Vimes: That is the distance the bar went away from the target.  I can't see inside the 30min bar for example to say which occurs first but assumes you would have to sit through potentially that excusion to get the risk off on the target retracement level, it maybe gives some calibration for the amount of risk tolerance you would have to give
18:59 Vimes: to do something more precise we would have to build a shorter time frame study, say 5min cancles, and analyze the actual intraday bars, i wanted to avoid that so went with something that is more of a guide
19:04 cajun: yep... a conservative eastimate.. sounds like then a worst case estimate?... since youre using the full length of the excursion .   and that means " avg win"  is a conservative underestimate of the same propirtion? 
19:06 Vimes: yes that is only the amount of positive expectancy on each ladder doesn't not net out a stop loss or whatever
19:09 cajun: im awed by the systematized step by step calculations .. will take me alot more code learning to fully understand.   seems like the math should be useful for extracting to other estimates.  nice work
19:15 Vimes: well thanks, not a coder, but can fake it every now and then
19:19 cajun: ha!
19:19 cajun: g.n. folks! all sweet dreams
19:21 Brad952: gn
19:22 MTS1: thanks TCuls!
19:23 Nube: Nice work, Vimes!
19:23 Vimes: ty
19:25 Vimes: Some typical observations on gap fills, i usually when you start to retrace to certain levels the probabiliy improves that you will close the full gap, this is similar to background on pivot points as well, this doesn't mean price has to do anything but just to be aware that once gaps start to retrace, there is positive expactancy that they will continue, so combined with other indicators can give some good trades, some also look at market internals at the open, tick, volume etc. to further screen gap fills
19:25 MTS1: a little long to read on my phone;) will check it out though, thanks for sharing!
19:26 slashgw: here is another study for gap fills if you have interest to check it out.  I did not write it.  it is from BigWaveDave http://tos.mx/uJmNWN#
19:27 MTS1: if it does not retrace though Vimes, higher possibility of a trend day for example
19:29 slashgw: it can be a trend day, till it turns and fills the gap ;)
19:30 MTS1: trend days oscillators don't work well & you should just get in when it pulls back to ma or trend line
19:31 slashgw: gap fill level is often a good entry location after it fills
19:32 slashgw: even if not on the same day
19:33 Vimes: Yes there are some theories that all gaps eventually fill with some high probability, but i have no data on that
19:33 slashgw: https://screencast.com/t/JfV5FBouM
19:34 slashgw: and the next one to look at on ES should be in the 2753 area
19:35 MTS1: I can see it's a natural SR level cuz people wish they bought at that point, jumping in when it gets back to that level
19:35 MTS1: *SR area
19:36 slashgw: https://screencast.com/t/3YqKK7TleIdJ
19:37 slashgw: well, imo, it's because of not getting left behind.
19:37 Vimes: that's the study you shared last week?
19:37 Vimes: or so
19:38 slashgw: the one in screencast  just showing the horizontal purple lines, yes.
19:39 slashgw: http://tos.mx/fubvrS#
19:40 Vimes: thx
19:42 G3_: nice charting slashgw
19:43 slashgw: with regard to ES, any gap greater than 10 points in either direction is considered a "pro gap & go", so odds are obviously much less to immediately fill.  then tend to just keep trading away, but when a trading setup does break, then typically the gap level will become the target.  But within that 10 point or less gap, odds of gapfill can be quite good.  as always, anything is possible though.
19:43 slashgw: thanks G3
19:46 Vimes: There was a trade setup proposed by noble, that related to overnight trade that exceeded the maintenance margin, the idea if the gap was that large folks woudl immediately cover causing a short burst of trade continuing
19:46 slashgw: ah, interesting theory.  thanks.
19:48 Ariana3: I've heard about a maintenance margin strategy before. Sounds interesting, do you guys have a strategy or an indicator for it?
19:49 G3_: a 10 point + gap?
19:50 G3_: seems it would have to be +15 to rattle thoses cages.
19:51 Ariana3: Yes, by Noble in a book The Trader's Edge, that is where I've read it.
19:51 Vimes: you would have to look at the contract specs, i think its something like 22 points on nq
19:51 Vimes: ^arana correct
19:51 G3_: I was referring to /es
19:51 Nube: 5000 worth of gap seems like it might be enough to spook margins and blow through a ot of stops so I can believe that
19:52 Nube: Traders are concerned, price continues because of covering and they bail out. Can see it.
19:52 Nube: arithmetic was never my strong suit
19:53 Nube: or reading or writing
19:53 slashgw: yeah, can def see it.  just never thought about it from that perspective.  always looked at it from a FOMO perspective.
19:53 slashgw: napping is my strong suit
19:53 slashgw: oh, and recess
19:54 Nube: Now we gotta make an overnight margin trouble script
19:54 slashgw: that could become an important one soon :)
19:55 Ariana3: He calls it "the Initial-Maintenance Opening Rule"
19:56 Vimes: i can't find my book, so don't recall the full details
19:56 Vimes: i think its the delta between the initial and maintenacne margin
19:56 Vimes: which maybe could vary by futures broker
19:56 Ariana3: I have it, hold on
19:57 G3_: when and if margin req are raised.  They are sure as hell not going to be lowered anytime soon. fwiw
19:58 Vimes: i recall the language in teh book being kind of murky, it was a bit dated
19:58 Ariana3: https://www.screencast.com/t/l7tiQglmX1

05:44 Lippy1m: Hello I am looking to do a simple scan with the relative strength of a stock crossing below the SPX and although I can get that to show up on my charts, I am having a hard time configuring a scan for the same.  Can anybody help me out please?
07:14 chief: Lippy, try this...note that I am not a scripter...
input length = 63;
def IWMPctChg = (close( period = "Day") / close( period = "Day")[length]) - 1;

#plot crossup = rs>0 and rs[1]<0;
plot crossdn = rs<0 and rs[1]>0;
07:15 chief: Wait, cannot have sec aggs in scan
07:16 chief: Try this....
def IWMPctChg = (close / close[length]) - 1;
def SPYPctChg = (close("SPY") / close("SPY")[length]) - 1;
07:45 chief: One last time hopefully...
def  PctChg = (close / close[length]) - 1;

07:47 JohnnyQuotron: Good morning thinkScript Lounge.
07:55 chief: GM, I think I scared Lippy away ,lol. I think TDA reports today
08:02 tarbog: hello, i have a simple script to draw the days mid point that just shows a horizontal line that move as new highs and lows are made.� how would i add a time factor to it to make it more like the vwap or a moving average that would track the mid point of the day to that time and leave that plot there and adjust through out the day so you could see where the mid point of the day was at any time of the day.    
08:08 Mobius: get the barNumber() at time and hold that value as the plot
08:12 Mobius: Example:
def time = if SecondsTillTime(0930) == 0
                  then barNumber()
                 else double.nan;
def price = if !isNaN(time)
                   then hl2
                  else price[1];
plot lineAtTime = if barNumber() >= HighestAll(time)
                              then highestAll(if isNaN(close[-1])
                                                        then price
                                                        else double.nan)
                             else double.nan;
08:13 Mobius: For more examples go to Mobius on MyTrade
08:13 chief: There is a built in study HighLowMA that may work for you also
08:13 chief: Midle high low MA
08:15 Mobius: +1% Globex range with avg volume. Should be a good trading range today.

09:36 gerardom: lol
09:36 radon224: Got a little bit of a tweezer double bottom on /es 5 min chart, just below S1....but doesn't seem like a strong signal to me.
09:37 DrHouse: AMD doing solid right nkw
09:37 DrHouse: *now
09:37 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: market could also go DOWN 1000 points, but it will go up or down :)
09:37 DrHouse: I don’t mind which way it goes as long as I manage to flip my positions fast enough
09:37 LLENA2: I have a quick question for yall, if I purchase say 100 shares of JPM today and sell 50 today, is that considered a day trade or will i need to sell 100 JPM today for it to be considered?
09:37 mep1976: picked up a little FNJN
09:38 gerardom: amd must be holding up well snce earnings is soon
09:38 fred__w: darryl  key is to react  not anticipate  and the reaction is in accord with a plan
09:38 TnT: yes, that is a day trade, cheez
09:39 LLENA2: both are consiered day trades?
09:39 TnT: day trade = round trip, so one day  trade
09:39 LLENA2: kk
09:39 LLENA2: thx
09:40 TnT: not rocket science, lol
09:40 fred__w: ..well  some have tried to apply rocket science to mkts
09:41 radon224: I apply the Shock Diamond method to my trading often
09:41 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: what's the best way to see if large block sells are coming in on a stock?  In real time.
09:42 TnT: click the time and sales tab on right side of chart
09:42 LLENA2: anyone here use john carters momentum strategy? or do yall just use intuition
09:42 LLENA2: times and sales
09:43 fred__w: darryl  i start with 5min action  then see if 15min rhymes in time  then 1hr  and so on  like that
09:43 mep1976: SOLD -1 HEAR 100 16 NOV 18 15 PUT @.86 EDGX
09:44 mep1976: don't mind owning this one 
09:44 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: this looks like strong bounce off 200 day
09:45 blondetrader: ya it does
09:45 blondetrader: but needs to break res and hold a good pullback
09:46 AlphaInvestor: Darryl - block trades are not as useful as in th past. Traders can now "spray" small orders across exchanges and time to hide their intent. if yoiu see a block trade, they WANT you to see it
09:46 invertedhammer: YM 400 looking short
09:48 radon224: well shoot, I guess that tweezer bottom was good afterall
09:45 Vimes: ping pong
09:57 Nube: Alpha did a momersion study and it got me looking for ways to determine market regimes. One of the places I looked was comparing an ETF price to it's asset value using the .NV ticker symbol. It's late to the party but in case it's useful for ETF buyers / traders
09:57 Nube: 
# Discount or Premium to Net Asset Value
#be sure to use .nv
# Nube 10.21.18
declare lower;
    #inputs
input netAssetValue = "SPY.NV";
    #variables
def c = close;
def nav = close(netAssetValue);
def discount = nav - c;
    #plots
plot 
discountToNetAssetValue = discount;
discountToNetAssetValue.AssignValueColor(if   discount < 0
                                         then Color.DownTick
                                         else Color.UpTick);
AddChartBubble(!IsNaN(c) and IsNaN(c[-1]), discount,
""+GetSymbol()+" disount or premium \nto "+netAssetValue+": "+discount, 
if discount < 0 then Color.DownTick else Color.UpTick, discount > 0);
09:58 Nube: Now we need on the masters to show us how to manipulate the string so get it to pull the .NV ticker automatically

10:18 AlphaInvestor: I am considering some AMZN at strong support way down at 1600
10:18 tmoney20g: well for now, let's see that 7250 test
10:20 AlphaInvestor: KenLH - risk and reward are opposiite sides of the same coin. If you combine what you see, with the Probabilities ... you wlll understand what I mean
10:03 AlphaInvestor: Nuibe - string concatonation is easy peasy - it is pulling them apart that is impossible
10:05 Nube: def test = close(GetSymbol()+".NV");
10:05 Nube: I should have given it one more shot before giving up
10:07 John1a: When VWAP does not open with the price, is this a bug in TOS? https://www.screencast.com/t/sils0LXI
10:08 Nube: New and Improved
def nav = close(GetSymbol()+".NV");
discountToNetAssetValue.SetDefaultColor(Color.Gray);
""+GetSymbol()+" disount to\n"+GetSymbol()+".NV: "+discount, 
10:09 AlphaInvestor: der we go
10:09 John1a: "Normal" VWAP open: https://www.screencast.com/t/rHD5u6q561bG
10:10 MTS1: John; is that the built-in VWAP? Does not look like it.
10:11 John1a: MTS1: Yes, built-in, I just did not plot STD bands, just the VWAP
10:12 John1a: The dashed horizontal line is the built-in VWAP
10:13 Vimes: what are you plotting, i don't see that on my charts
10:13 MTS1: have not seen it behave like that John
10:14 John1a: Does not happen often, but if you do , for example, 60 days, 15 minutes on ES or RTY and scroll to the left, you will see a number of days when it did that
10:17 Vimes: sorry, i don't see that
10:19 MTS1: Looks like hte VWAP script uses the VWAP fundamental price value; if you're seeing the wrong 'price' or vwap value it may be a data feed issue on those time aggregations; not sure what days you see them on, are they holidays or other weird gaps?
10:19 John1a: Here is an exa ple on ES, starting on 09/10/18: https://www.screencast.com/t/qBFpFPnYug
10:19 MTS1: (uses VWAP and Volume)
10:23 Vimes: uncheck adjust for contract changes
10:23 John1a: ITt goes way back, for example, from 08/02/18, past 09/10/18 every day overnight open was like that
10:23 Vimes: or plot the exact contract
10:24 Nube: post the script, John1a
10:25 AlphaInvestor: undoubtedly PEBKAC error
10:25 John1a: Vimes: Interesting, unchecking fixed it, but isn't suppose to work with a continues contract?
10:26 John1a: Nube: It is a VWA which is in TOS
10:26 AlphaInvestor: is Start Aggregaion at Market Open checked?
10:26 John1a: VWAP
10:26 Vimes: its something you will never see in real time imo, its only in trying to back correct teh continuous contract, don't know the math behind how they do this
10:26 John1a: Alpha: No
10:27 DMonkey: John. Just write your own and initialize from your starting bar. Vwap isn’t hard to calculate.
10:27 MTS1: I can't replicate it on those dates / times; try it on a different computer John
10:27 Vimes: they are at minimum two instruments they are trying to blend together so maybe not so easy to make it look seamless
10:28 Nube: John, what time frame do you ahve selected?
10:28 John1a: If I uncheck "Adjust for contract changes" it snaps to the Globex open bar and looks correct
10:29 John1a: Nube: 15 minutes
10:30 Nube: No tchart aggregation. What time frame do oyu have selected in thte study input?
10:30 AlphaInvestor: he has DAY selected
10:30 Nube: I suspect you have day but want something else
10:31 John1a: Yes, day, no that is what I wanted, Day VWAP that starts at the session open (Globex) and goes till the end of the RTH
10:32 Nube: You don't get a choice in what time or price it begins calculating at, If you want that you would need to write your own as mentioned by DMonkey above.
10:33 John1a: What do you mean? Day starts at the rollover line on ES, RTY, etc
10:34 John1a: If I want it to always start at the rollover line I need to write my own?
10:35 Nube: I don't know what the study you have up is calculating from and neither do you. Write your own, be sure
10:37 Vimes: i may no t know either but seems like the solution is to uncheck adjust for contract changes, maybe i'm not seeing what you are seeing
10:37 John1a: I don't know how to write my own, but I have this

10:38 John1a: How would I write my own differently, the code above is from TOS
10:38 Nube: Try pasting that into a new study. Nobody can duplicate your problem using the stock study. IF the problem persists, contact ToS and let them know about it
10:40 John1a: If you have Adjust for contract changes checked, you don't see the same thing on ES on 09/10/18?
10:41 Vimes: i do not
10:42 John1a: Oh, ok, got it. I'll contact support. Thank you all.
10:43 Vimes: but unless you are doing some kind of backtesting who cares, teh current vwap will be on the actie contract
10:45 John1a: Vimes: Yes, I am doing some backtesting
10:46 JoshuaK: i have a question regarding how TOS references values from studies
10:46 John1a: How do I force it to start at the rollover line? Without unchecking "Adjust for contract changes" ?
10:47 Vimes: 9/10 per your request - i don't see the issue
 
10:47 JoshuaK: so lets say i go to Marketwatch>Quotes>customize the tool bar so that it has open close VWAP
10:47 JoshuaK: the VWAP is close study that has plots
10:47 JoshuaK: how does the column know to reference the specific value in the study called VWAP
10:47 John1a: Vimes: Do you have overnight displayed and Adjust for contract changes checked?
10:48 JoshuaK: the reason i ask because i have someself defined studies, and im  tryingto display only the values, but the study itself plots things. Im just trying to extract the value itself, and display it in a column
10:49 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current.
10:22 VolCrush: they bot dat wee dip

11:09 esmal: which come to you in bull's clothing
11:09 esmal: but inwardly they are ravening bears
11:10 mep1976: yea AL - let's see what happens , but i love my current gig but i think future isn't bright no more here. gotta make a move stinks cause i work from home this would be a office i would have to go to lol
11:10 VolCrush: will it is Halloween
11:10 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: no need to be snippy.   just going by visual.  after checking actual 5m there is a slight outperfomance by tech xlk compared to nasdaq index, but tech is deeply oversold so no surprise.
11:11 VolCrush: guess wat guys
for Halloween
im dressing up as bronx, and bronx is dressin up as W
11:12 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: tech is more volatile than broad market either up or down.  and has been for last 40 years.
11:12 invertedhammer: Short crude .96
11:12 AlphaInvestor: Do  they make red-soled pumps in size 12?
11:13 VolCrush: no we had to go custom
11:13 mep1976: SDPI no pullback under 4.50 gez
11:14 VolCrush: nice call IH
11:14 TnT: I'm will dress up as a TSA agent
11:14 mep1976: CRON and NBEV hmmm
11:14 VolCrush: with TnT strapped around your waist
11:14 tmoney20g: darn, gonna miss the dip
11:17 VolCrush: CMG* gunna run like a red head in County Tipperary
11:17 VolCrush: kiss der baby
11:17 VolCrush: whos got juice
11:18 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: right or wrong on wat i said about tech?
11:18 VolCrush: dead wrong
11:19 ScottishClaymore1: Any thoughts on Largo Resources & the rocket rise of Vanadium?
11:19 VolCrush: actually one of the worst observations ive ever read on here.......i would put it in the no clue category
11:20 radon224: c'mon, don't hold back....say what you really think
11:20 VolCrush: ok, it was the most idjit comment ive ever read
11:20 AlphaInvestor: that is pretty tame for Vol
11:20 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: ok mr expert :)  you have no idea of the history of tech
11:20 RandomDan: URI Marcos? Really? I just added it to my watchlist on the theory that infrastructure goes back on the table if the D's take the house.
11:21 VolCrush: we are talking today not history, mate
and your comment was way way off
11:21 VolCrush: meanwhile CMG* hod
11:23 VolCrush: if Ds take the house they support the Donald on infrastructure???  hmmmm, not sure about that....i give it some thought
why would Ds support der D in his third year??
11:24 mep1976: SOLD -3 CRON 100 16 NOV 18 8 PUT @.90 BATS
11:25 mep1976: give me more CRON
11:25 mep1976: SOLD -1 NBEV 100 16 NOV 18 5 PUT @1.05
11:25 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I jus told you earlier i agree that it is slightly outperfoming today, thats bc tech is way oversold.
11:25 mep1976: and my liquid weed lol 
11:25 radon224: Infrastructure spending has always been the one thing that almost everyone could agreee on.  The problem is any Bill would have about 1,000 unrelated "riders" attached to it and make it distasteful to everyone.
11:25 VolCrush: WTF is CRON, going to zero
11:26 radon224: /es back down to S1 now, strange day
11:27 RandomDan: Vol, because it is not politically tenable for them to sit on their hands for two years.
11:29 mep1976: i don't think cron will see that vol 
11:29 RandomDan: Anyway, it's a posdible play. It doesn't actually need to happen. All that is required is some noise in that direction, because infra has been so punished.
11:30 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: my biggest wonder is how AAPL is holding up so well to this tech onslaught.   if chip stocks are predicting slower sales ahead, then seems like AAPL sales would slow too.
11:30 RandomDan: buybacks
11:30 VolCrush: logic has never paid well
11:31 RandomDan: also a shift over time to service revenue
11:32 AlphaInvestor: Logic pays well, but you need to be very patient until Greed and Fear subside and Logic takes over
11:32 VolCrush: i dont have 30 years
11:32 Fano: FB pre earnings buy? FAANG bounce back?
11:34 tmoney20g: chips have huge inventory, correct ?
11:34 tmoney20g: aapl's products don't have that inventory problem, i guess
11:34 VolCrush: bronx, u still got MSFT*
11:34 tmoney20g: plus buybacks
11:34 blondetrader: yes sir
11:35 VolCrush: kul so do i , fur now

11:35 VolCrush: the Dems, should save the day on XLI
11:36 RandomDan: Marcos around?
11:36 tmoney20g: marcooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooos
11:36 AlphaInvestor: Dan - I am going to hold off on URI unitl it gets closer to support at 1000
11:36 AlphaInvestor: sorry 100
11:37 tmoney20g: 1000 would be good tho
11:37 VolCrush: Bronx ill call you on my strategy for MSFT* this week, after the close
11:37 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: today is day 8 of an attempted market bottom, if we can somehow finish strong, it might signal  a bottom bc volume is way outpacing Friday.
11:38 RandomDan: I understand Al. I just track better when I have a little skin. Probably got 1/6th of my target position, assuming I don't bail.
11:38 mep1976: im here
11:39 RandomDan: hey Marcos it took me three days but finally was able to sell the NIO puts @ .70
11:39 mep1976: lol nice !

12:49 AlphaInvestor: what ticker?

12:50 Harv: wow thanks for the feedback

13:04 IanR: With a name like that I’m sure you’ve got lots of opinions
13:07 Vimes: IanR, i don't know the fundies on  TOPS, i would worry about the actual impact on trade on trans ocean shippers, this maybe is a surge before tarrifs are in place who knows, you want to trade it that's one thing but not sure there is enough clarity for an investment
13:08 chenmann: amtd er ah, lets see how much $ they made off of us
13:09 Vimes: i hope alot because they are going to put it all back into the platform :)

14:54 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: "der fruit" weakened too with shooting star.
14:54 chenmann: gonna get out on this littlr  bounce
14:54 chenmann: little
14:55 VolCrush: yah, vary weak close
14:55 ScottishClaymore1: Largo Resources (LGORF)& Vanadium. The future is Vanadium Redox Batteries for the Power Grid Storage. Way better than Lithium. Vanadium has boat loads of other uses as well. China is buying it by the arm loads.
14:56 VolCrush: i stopped reading on the word China
14:56 TnT: oh boy, a penny pusher
14:57 VolCrush: frankly these pussies that come in pumping there pennies is just humor
14:57 VolCrush: *their
14:57 chenmann: out .35, .35 loss
14:57 chenmann: at least we know where the sellers live....
14:58 AlphaInvestor: oh oh, somebody set a booby trap Pump & Dump Claymore

15:00 VolCrush: haha
15:00 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: took no action except for SBUX short which i got out of with small small loss,  thinking i should've went in short at close.
15:01 ScottishClaymore1: Seriously look it up & tell me I am wrong after you do your homework. Better than over saturated pot stocks. Who knows which ones survive in that muck.
15:01 VolCrush: not a gud close to be sure
shift to futters trading ON
15:02 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: scott, be careful with those penny stocks.  
15:03 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: shooting star 25 minutes ago was good sell signal.  I woulda coulda shoulda went short then  :(
15:03 ScottishClaymore1: I am. I have my stops in.
15:04 mep1976: trades on otc ewwww
15:04 AlphaInvestor: AMTD beat E, beat R
15:05 AlphaInvestor: its actually profitable, wow
15:05 TnT: Vanadium batteries have been around a long long time, they are huge for capacity, very low energy density, can't possibly compete with Lithium batteries
15:05 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: trying to spot the next apple in those pennie is "fruit"less.  
15:05 ScottishClaymore1: Honestly look into Vanadium in general. I like Largo but that is my pick. Not many to choose from in that area.
15:05 TnT: berg
15:06 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Metals are looking better for sure.
15:06 fred__w: one curious tidbit is my etf pair is unslipping  has been for a while now
15:06 ScottishClaymore1: Again. Doesn't hurt to take a peek.
15:06 TnT: we do not need penny pushers in here
15:07 TnT: /PA was a big winner today, up 3.69%
15:07 ScottishClaymore1: I am usually not a penny pusher. Rode FCX up from just over $5 to 17
15:07 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: when you get those flyers in the mail, just toss em.  they are pump and dump schemes.
15:07 ScottishClaymore1: Also NOG from 1.72 to now
15:08 TnT: /ES 1.6 m
