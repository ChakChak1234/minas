15:30 TnT: anywho, have a good weekend
15:30 blondetrader: bye AL
15:30 AlphaInvestor: Laters
15:30 RandomDan: bye Al
15:30 VolCrush: i'd be happy to cut off all imports from China, product sucks and is poorly made

the average american will be crushed but at least they'll have a job: production


15:31 RandomDan: blonde, just not seeing a deal
15:31 VolCrush: cheers, Alpha
15:31 blondetrader: maybe I am too optimistic
15:31 TnT: indeed
15:32 blondetrader: but if I am right each of you has to send me candy
15:32 TnT: that would be a big win for the peeps that Xi does not want in power
15:32 blondetrader: :)
15:32 VolCrush: i'll send u red soled shoes
15:32 blondetrader: haha
15:32 RandomDan: Vol, just about all IT equipment is mafe in China now. And the quality is exactly what the manufactrers will pay for.
15:33 TnT: and includes spy chips in the servers
15:33 blondetrader: lol
15:33 VolCrush: yah, and for that they get the IT.........ah, vary bad deal, @dan
15:33 blondetrader: thats too funny
15:33 VolCrush: sorry IP
15:33 TnT: funny but true, huge security issues
15:34 VolCrush: it's the IP that is horrid
15:34 blondetrader: oh I know it
15:34 RandomDan: I don't disagree
15:34 TnT: including gov computers and servers that handle other classified material
15:34 blondetrader: but this is what we have become bc of bad deals
15:34 TnT: YES
15:34 VolCrush: once they have all the IP, they compete, cut prices and the USA is *ucked, just bad biz
15:35 blondetrader: sometimes a little pain is good in the long run
15:35 VolCrush: chit, they just made a fighter plane based on blue prints stolen from th US
15:36 RandomDan: My point is that the industry wanted this. They lobbied hard.
15:36 blondetrader: wanted what
15:36 RandomDan: Same with H1B.
15:36 VolCrush: yah, cuz of wages
15:36 TnT: this admin realized there were chinese surveillance cameras that were purchased and installed on military bases.  They kinda put an end to that
15:36 VolCrush: and Uniouns, which have killed America
15:36 RandomDan: Wanted to outsource to China.
15:37 VolCrush: Unions were set up to save children from labor
15:37 TnT: Vol, it was really tax incentives for big companies to off shore manufacturing and other jobs
15:37 VolCrush: way back in der industrial age
15:37 blondetrader: oh right u r dan
15:37 VolCrush: Unions????? ah no
15:38 VolCrush: outsource cuz of unions, cut cost
15:38 VolCrush: simple
15:38 VolCrush: basic economics
15:38 RandomDan: unions by themselves are not a problem. Germany has larger, more powerful unions and their manufacturing rocks
15:38 TnT: that is part of it
15:38 VolCrush: cuz everything here is union
15:38 TnT: all very complex
15:39 TnT: in any case, the US is now improving
15:39 VolCrush: in Germany they don't pay for school or medicine totally diff issue
15:39 VolCrush: and they pay a higher tax %
15:39 TnT: I'm gone, all enjoy
15:39 VolCrush: not comparable
15:40 VolCrush: cheers TnT
15:42 VolCrush: it's like all the cos that outsourced their call center over seas, no one could understand them and nothing was done correctly....total cluster *uck, but it saved money for the cos.......consumer, not so much
15:42 blondetrader: oh and how
15:43 RandomDan: just saying... these are multiple factor problems. Not good to oversimplify or blame one thing.
15:43 VolCrush: all part of cost, unions...etc
15:43 VolCrush: who is over simpilfying?
15:43 VolCrush: it is a wholistic issue
15:44 blondetrader: I dont know enough about all this
15:44 RandomDan: "unions killed America"
15:44 VolCrush: yah, they have
15:44 VolCrush: unions were set up for child labor laws
15:45 blondetrader: but I see we have big things happening
15:45 VolCrush: during the industrial revolution
15:45 blondetrader: and imo will be good for makret
15:45 admin_tculs: Again   please keep commentary civil and market related
15:45 blondetrader: at least for 1/2 of 2019
15:45 RandomDan: Vol, do comps with other countries. Less union labor in US than in more competitive countries.
15:47 VolCrush: nope, that's not were our labor is going, it's going to countries with little to no labor laws

you are simply wrong, with all due respect

we knew wat we were doing (CEO's) and now we have to solve the problem we created
15:47 VolCrush: for example why ever buy something made by NKE
15:49 VolCrush: we are talking to 2 diff issues, you are talking about labor in the US

i'm talking about products consumed by US but made outside of the US, wat > 60% of crap

2 diff issues
15:49 RandomDan: also, America isn't dead.
15:50 VolCrush: no , but while i didn't vote for him DT, does want to change the land scape on multiple dimension.....that i agree with
15:51 RandomDan: I did not vote for DT but I do favor his stance with China, though not his style.
15:51 VolCrush: welp, on dat we agree
15:52 RandomDan: I just think we need to remember that "China" includes for example Tim Cook.
15:52 VolCrush: there's a reason i've been a registered Indy for over 30 years, LOL

15:53 VolCrush: yah even the fruit got reeemed for labor practices overseas, just like NKE


15:53 RandomDan: At work I found an old PowerMac G5. Made in the USA. I felt like crap.
15:54 VolCrush: keep it, it's an antique and worth mula!!
15:54 RandomDan: It was from the early 2000's, not that long ago. It was perfectly possible.
15:55 RandomDan: I should have grabbed it.
15:56 yoz: Ok.. so I think I understand.. going back to one of my main rules.. never be in aftermarket.. I thought these Canadian tickers shut down for trading after the bell, but I guess there's activity TOS doesn't capture?  Market value says 6.32  on MMNFF now but the last candle says 5.99... in other words, never be in after market ever even on pink slip OTC stocks.. 
15:58 VolCrush: ok good chatting @dan and all, i respect everyone's opinion and everyone has a voice, from which we will all make our own trading plan

have a gud weekend
