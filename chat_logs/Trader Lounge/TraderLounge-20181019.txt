09:00 mep1976: so is anyone buying NIO here for long term ?
09:00 mep1976: haven't done research on them
09:02 Markus55: blond-how do you get that support number for nq
09:02 Markus55: is it a daily sma?
09:02 blondetrader: its based on the prev 5 days range.....and forms a fib pivot for today

09:04 Tanya: Good morning everyone
09:04 blondetrader: gm Tanya
09:04 Tanya: Bt
09:05 JabbaTheCabin: markus = there are also those who swear by market profile studies, which is volume based.
09:06 blondetrader: yep... my syst draws on the strenths of wave profile and fibs
09:07 blondetrader: throws out the fluff parts of each
09:07 radon224: Some Market Profile studies are TPO based
09:07 radon224: a little diff than volume alone
09:07 Tanya: Marco, NIO looks ok for longer term
09:08 blondetrader: volume is not concidered in my set up
09:08 blondetrader: volume in its generic term
09:09 featherweight: BT
09:09 featherweight: I need your help
09:09 blondetrader: ?
09:09 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: SBUX, breakout to upside other day.  looking for possible reversal
09:10 featherweight: I want to start as an independent trader and wanted to pick your brain if you’re so inclined
09:10 blondetrader: sure
09:11 radon224: If you venture into bt's brain, remember to take a ball of string with you so you can find your way out
09:11 featherweight: Is there a way to dm my email to you or vice versa somehow?
09:11 blondetrader: LOL radon
09:11 featherweight: Lol I’ll try my best
09:11 blondetrader: no feather but u can leave me a mesage on my loast post in mytrade and I will answer
09:12 blondetrader: last
09:12 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: NKE right at a lower trendline rising wedge.  might get bounce here though.  ST looking for 73
09:16 JabbaTheCabin: i look at volume as an indicator of follow through. eg. if we have a sharp downmove on high voliume and a retracement at low volume, I am going to assume that the retracement will not hold.
09:17 JabbaTheCabin: that informs me as to whether or not to hold a position.
09:18 blondetrader: for me vol is too abstract 1. I never know when it will appear 2. I have seen many a sustained move cont on low vol
09:18 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: SBUX is reversing.  where do i want to go short?  That's the question.  Want to see railroad tracks on the weekly!  That would be below 58.
09:18 blondetrader: so its just one less thing I have to look at
09:19 invertedhammer: One off 69.20. 69.70 next
09:19 JabbaTheCabin: each to his own blondetrader. I trade (short) equity options much more than equities or future, so my time horizon is longer than daytraders.
09:19 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: yep, like I thot!  NKE trying to bounce right here off lower trendline wedge.
09:19 blondetrader: sbux has support just below 58
09:20 featherweight: BT just posted. Thanks again!
09:20 blondetrader: ditto Jabba
09:20 blondetrader: many ways to skin the cat
09:20 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I know bt, that;s why i want to see more weakness.
09:21 JabbaTheCabin: ii like how NFLX has pretty much negated the move over earnings. I have a short IC which I put on after earnings that is looking good.
09:22 JabbaTheCabin: true, blondetrader.
09:22 blondetrader: yes a close under that support would be good for a few bucks
09:25 mep1976: bitcoin very stable
09:26 JabbaTheCabin: might try a SBUX strangle closer to earnings.
09:27 JabbaTheCabin: another word for "dead", mep
09:27 Lou K.: GM! ?With all these 20% pullbacks lately , do you think we might not see a major pullback over the next 24 months?
09:27 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: my instincts tell me NFLX might attempt a breakout over ST,  over 386.80, but I am not buying it.  But doesn't look like any breakout today.
20:39 amalia: I was waiting for bt to come back but I'm good here if you're good for the night, admin_tculs. Thanks for staying late with me. See you tomorrow?
20:42 admin_tculs: gn amalia

06:57 radon224: Monthly OPEX today....bleah
06:57 radon224: forgot about that
06:57 blondetrader: let the games begin
06:57 radon224: Actually most of the action on OPEX occurs on the Wed. before from what I've seen
06:58 radon224: But there will be pinning, and other games
07:00 blondetrader: yup
07:00 blondetrader: got to go slow and wait for the right pitch
07:01 streetglide: and whiff on that pitch like the Astros
07:03 blondetrader: hummm
07:04 streetglide: anything in charts that suggest bottoming or rotation up or just bounces and rotation down, bt?
07:05 blondetrader: nothing to suggest bottoming....
07:05 blondetrader: if u scroll up I posted the next week hope levels to maybe change the short term bias
07:05 blondetrader: I will adjust them as we head into the close
07:07 blondetrader: I am going to take some time today to sell calls against my long term stocks and maybe buy some cheap puts to further hedge
07:07 blondetrader: also going to look at some option plays for things i like lower 
07:08 radon224: cheap puts might be hard to come by
07:08 streetglide: ok thanks
07:08 blondetrader: ya radon I found that with AMZN yest
07:08 blondetrader: but if I go only 2 weeks out I will back ratio most names
07:08 blondetrader: for flat or small credit

08:16 fred__w: was i lost?
08:16 Mirai: For cash account:
"Available Funds for Trading" says "N/A" and Day Trades Left is "0" (zero)
Am I able to place trades? Is this normal? Does the cash need to settle first?
"Option Buying Power" and "Net Liq Day Trades" accurately reflect the account balance though.
08:16 tmoney20g: apparently
08:16 ameriman: Fred went MIA last night
08:16 Kobias: VIX      - 3.5%
08:16 ameriman: Everyone was looking, helicopter search
08:16 tmoney20g: options clear next day, stocks could be T+2 days
08:16 fred__w: i have end of day wrap up  perhaps thats it
08:17 chenmann: found him....
08:17 chenmann: i was the first in the water looking for u fred

08:22 fred__w: so far  so good
08:24 AlphaInvestor: Gm Nug
08:25 Dixie: Fred, I was missing too, so I didnt know there was a search party
08:27 fred__w: dixie  i dont recall meeting you  welcome
09:49 ruffle: Trying to find newly IPO&aposd stocks
09:49 ruffle: Or IPO within x number of days
09:50 MTS1: Ruffle; that's quite  different than your earlier example; what does that statement mean in plain english? 
09:50 MTS1: In any casep if there is no bar 100 days ago there is no close; but that's different than NaN
09:51 MTS1: NaN means there is a 'bar 'but no value for close; like the expansion area. If you want items with less than 100 bars simply use BarNumber() function
09:52 ruffle: Is appendix d wrong? OHLC values of the current symbol are NaN when a script tries to retrieve them from the time point before IPO or before the first visible bar on tick and range charts. The same happens when the script tries to retrieve OHLC values from the right expansion of the chart (i.e., from the time point in the "future", which doesn&apost have any OHLC values yet).
09:52 Mobius: Arianna - It's impossible for you to offend me. My statement stands regardless of your past use.  Zscore is a simple indicator of where price is in a standard deviation envelope. The levels are simple reminders of excepted standards. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 standard deviations from the mean.  If you knew what you were looking at you'd have known that
09:53 MTS1: Nope; example from D rowks fine
09:53 Ariana3: Mobius: I know that, I asked how to write in the code.
09:54 ruffle: Seems like you&aposre telling me "OHLC values of the current symbol are NaN when a script tries to retrieve them from the time point before IPO or before the first visible bar on tick and range charts" is not true?
09:54 ruffle: Is not true?
09:54 Mobius: I gave you the code.  The only thing you need to do is add
plot one = 1;
plot two = 2;
plot three = 3;
09:55 MTS1: Debug it Ruffle and check it out; I also gave you a solution I know works.
09:55 Ariana3: Mobius: Thank you very much!
09:57 Mobius: Just as a reminder -
We don't work for TOS. We're traders interested in helping other traders to learn to code. We appreciate those that try to learn. Those that just want a code because they don't know how to code are encouraged to learn to code. Anyone can that works at it a bit.
09:59 ruffle: Ok I&aposll try that. Still puzzling to me why the other way doesn&apost work. Seems like exactly what app d is stating!
09:59 Mobius: ruffle - keep at it - the light will shine just before the train hits you
10:00 ruffle: Thanks guys & thanks Möbius I was starting to think you might work for ToS! Ya&aposll are really awesome for helping us!
10:09 inov: hello Mobius...thanks for ur reply but I would like to know the highest intraday volume, let's say around 1:00 p.m or any time before end of RTH.....any tips on how to code will be helpful
10:21 Vimes: inov, what you are requesting will predominatly be the open or close as mobius said, it could be coded as you requested, but maybe as an alternative look at this "high volume node" code from Mobius:
# High Volume Nodes
# Mobius
# V01.02.2018
# Looks for the highest volume candle in "n" periods and plots the candle range. 
# As Volatility increases this study has two values. Plotting a current high volume node as a channel which price will be drawn back to and test since a very high volume node will move price quickly, and price will retest that area. And, with the legacy plots a way to quickly see if larger traders, those that can generate a high volume node, are accumulating or distributing inventory. 
input n = 20;
input LegacyPoints = yes;
def h = high;
def l = low;
def c = close;
def v = volume;
def x = barNumber();
def HighVolume = if ((v - Lowest(v, n)) / (Highest(v, n) - Lowest(v, n))) >= 1
                 then x
                 else Double.NaN;
def hh = if !IsNaN(HighVolume)
         then h
         else hh[1];
def ll = if !IsNaN(HighVolume)
         then l
         else ll[1];
plot hhLine = if x >= HighestAll(HighVolume)
              then HighestAll(if IsNaN(c)
                              then hh
                              else Double.NaN)
              else Double.NaN;
hhLine.SetDefaultColor(Color.GRAY);
plot llLine = if x >= HighestAll(HighVolume)
                              then ll
llLine.SetDefaultColor(Color.GRAY);
plot legacy = if LegacyPoints and !IsNaN(HighVolume)
              then l - (2*TickSize())
legacy.SetStyle(Curve.POINTS);
legacy.SetLineWeight(3);
legacy.SetDefaultColor(Color.Gray);
AddCloud(llLine, hhLine, Color.GRAY, Color.GRAY);
# End Code High Volume Nodes
10:21 nextrade: that gave me  an interesting idea to propose to TDA. I would think that the small fortune that TDA has spent to attract the 11 million funded accounts - was to increase their profits-not to teach all of us how  to code ; which is in itself a lengthy and to some a fruitless endeavor.I would think most of the 11 million clients just want to place trades ( which is revenue for TDA ) - not to be coders. So- '' Hey TDA - how about hiring a smart coder to help clients design the scripts that they wish to use in trading ''. If it increases their trading activity ( and you make more fees); then you keep the coder in house. If TDA does not see an increase in trading activity- you fire his a_ _.
10:23 Vimes: i think they could do more, but they at least try to stay connected with some developments like TASC and provide those indicators in platform each month
10:23 AlphaInvestor: Next - they have some peeps who do that for High Net Worth and Active Traders -- I know, becuase I know some of those people, not because I am one
10:24 Up_n_Up: how the other half lives
10:26 nextrade: guess i'll have to sell the Farm - to increase my account size -)
10:26 inov: thanks Vimes
10:28 Vimes: np, Mobius is primary to thank as i find alot of use in that indicator
10:30 nextrade: Ai- 20 years ago i was with a broker, and my account rep was a former salesclerk. He non-chalantly told me that he liked working for a broker, because he got to see the big money accounts- and their monetflow
10:32 Mobius: As in much of life - It's not what you know but who you know that often makes the difference.
10:34 AlphaInvestor: I know Mobius ... it has made a huge difference
10:35 AlphaInvestor: Thank you kind sir!
10:35 inov: Thanks Mobius for your help
10:35 Mobius: ha - You need to get out more often  :)
10:36 Nube: Having someone else write my scripts for me does not appeal to me one bit. The wisdom of that has to be inversely proportional to account size.
10:38 AlphaInvestor: Nube - I am more than happy to have you and Mobius write scripts for me!
10:43 Nube: Better be sure, my scripts have me long Turkey and Brazilian Small Caps
10:44 Nube: The good part of that is that if those trades work then ES is going to 5k so we'll all be riding high
10:46 AlphaInvestor: Nube - I think the elections in Brazil will turn those markets, to some extent already have
10:51 Nube: I'm a firm believer in the bullish politics is gridlock
10:51 Nube: So could well be
10:56 Mobius: Seems Brazil is always about something short. Brazillian Bikini, Brazillian Wax ......... Maybe Short is just a better idea
10:57 Nube: I ain't bullish on this thing their century, so maybe I should hedge...
10:59 online1: @Alpha or others - is it possible to have this scan show results for the net change starting from the 9:30 open?  I have no idea how to do modify.
http://tos.mx/6jbtdI#
couldn't sshot as was too bid and then couldn't see if made smaller
11:23 Nube: Watching what we do here like a hawk.
11:36 New_Trade: I just would like to follow Mobius trades...So many scripts only confusing but following big money...would be great   Better learning experience 
11:36 MTS1: Online; looks like you shared a wachlist, not a scan query or the script. Look at Mobius' ORB script for example of checking if the time has passed (Active) so you can retain the open so you can use it to compare with current close to calc net change.
11:37 MTS1: Agreed NT; good attitude. Not just see the trades though; understand trade decisions.
11:38 New_Trade: Yes I need to learn a lot
11:40 New_Trade: So would be great to ask Mobius to have teaching and trading room  He learned from his dad....
11:41 MTS1: He already spends as much time here as he likes;)
11:41 New_Trade: Agree he is helping a lot
11:41 MTS1: He's retired you know; in the right way it sounds like: Doing what he enjoys;)
11:44 New_Trade: It is very hard to learn by myself.    Zillions scripts not really helping.   I would like to find a better way to learn to make money
11:46 AlphaInvestor: In the long run you need no more than a dozen indicators, mosly likely about 6 or so, carefully selected
11:50 New_Trade: And how to use them right way
11:50 AlphaInvestor: Xactly
11:52 MTS1: scripts are just tools to help you see what's happening with price. key is finding what works for you; usually that means lots of chart reading / testing. Then have a trading plan based on what you know statistically works and follow that plan. Record your trading decisions and review those in hindsight to hopefully improve going forward (how you followed / did not follow your plan and how to improve plan / execution). Indicators are probably only a very small part of what it takes to make money...
11:52 woodie: oooops sorry wrong place
11:54 woodie: thanks admin
11:57 amalia: Dang it. Missed it.
11:57 amalia: Next time don’t be so good at your job admin =p
11:58 AlphaInvestor: amalia - Woodies 4 up Grid setup
12:36 amalia: Got it. Thanks librarians
12:45 Vimes: different platform
12:50 online1: MTSI - it is basically this -
 
12:50 online1: but the change is from the close of yesterday and I would like the net change to be from the 9:30 opening
12:51 amalia: What's the formula for net change?
13:05 DMonkey: net change from open....
def o = if secondsFromTime(0930) == 0 
        then open
        else o[1];
plot change = c - o;
13:07 donh: Mobius, Ever since TOS changed the futures to a two digit suffix rather the one,  the SpotRisk study that you created does not seem to work at all.  Can you suggest a fix?  Looking at your code, I only see that the problem may be associated to the GetSymbol()=="/NQ".  Appreciate any suggestion?
13:08 amalia: The mobile friendly version:
declare lower;
def o = if GetTime() crosses RegularTradingStart(GetYYYYMMDD())
then Open
else o[1];
plot change = c- o;
13:09 MTS1: Don; confirm the current value for /NQ in your charting window and update the script with the new value TOS is using now
13:10 MTS1: believe /NQ:XCME for NQ
13:11 donh: MTSI - Thanks I'll try your suggestion.
13:14 amalia: donh, please exit and re-enter the room. Thanks.
13:16 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current.
13:17 donh: MTSI - Thanks again.   Your suggestion worked.
13:18 MTS1: yw
13:20 donh: The room seems choppy and slow even after following Amalia's request t exit and reenter the room.  Logging out for now.  
13:21 MTS1: room seems fine; the logging back in was to fix your font. Sorry (not) if we're too slow to respond;)

13:55 HighDesertZero: I need to read up on referencing one study within another what topic heading would that come under?
13:56 AlphaInvestor: High - you can Reference built-in studies, but not custom user studies
13:57 HighDesertZero: grrrrrrrr, thanks alpha
14:01 amalia: You can use Script{}
14:46 em11: http://tos.mx/ldV5mA#    hi all, can some one direct me on where to find info on how to code the highest and the lowest of the colored interval ... two EMA crossing, highest and lowest of the candles located when fast EMA below slow EMA
14:56 thomas7156: Trying  to create a custom scan code to select stocks which are above the MA midpoint and the Upper_Band of a Keltner Channel. With the MA as a variable zero point the selection channel would fall in a range of about +1.25 and +2.5 times the MA. Here id the thinkscript

Useless function invocation at 6:1
At least one plot should be defined

15:01 Vimes: really like maybe something with the word "trade" or "trader" in it
15:02 AlphaInvestor: or Worthless, or GoingToZero
15:03 Mobius: Totally Dude
15:03 thomas7156: Mobius gave me the following yesterday  and perhaps I changed something wrong. Any help would be greatly appreciated
15:03 Vimes: do penny stocks even have options, whats teh point
15:04 em11: thank you Mobius, always appreciated
15:05 Mobius: yw
15:06 Mobius: Vimes - This is no place for logic..  Oh wait, maybe it is.  Good point!
15:07 Vimes: if only i could afford 100 shares of this penny stock, oh wait let me buy the options!!
15:10 Mobius: thomas.. the syntax for referencing a study in the scanner is
StudyName()."PlotName"
if your going to change any input in the study that change with the input name has to be added between the parentheses
Example:
StudyName(length = 30)."PlotName"
15:39 Biometrizilla: Have a question about indexing. If I create a new study with def x = x[1]; plot showx = x; then x is always zero. Then if I change to def x=x[1]+1; and plot, x starts at 2 and increases by one for each bar. I thought that defining x sets it to zero so x[1]+1 should start at 1. I have used the x=x[1]+1; in a couple of custom studies and have x[1]+1 starting at 2 for one study, x[1]+1 starting at 13 for another. Does ThinkScript do some sort of auto-lookback period determination that determines the value of x[1] for each study?
15:41 Mobius: If you want to index x then use compoundValue
compoundValue(1, x[1] + 1, 1)
where the first variable is the bar to start the second is the variable to perform and the third variable is the initial value
15:45 Biometrizilla: Does that mean that the code on the Web site for Inertia is incorrect?
15:45 Biometrizilla: script inertiaTS {
    input y = close;
    input n = 20;
    def x = x[1] + 1;
    def a = (n * Sum(x * y, n) - Sum(x, n) * Sum(y, n) ) / ( n * Sum(Sqr(x), n) - Sqr(Sum(x, n)));
    def b = (Sum(Sqr(x), n) * Sum(y, n) - Sum(x, n) * Sum(x * y, n) ) / ( n * Sum(Sqr(x), n) - Sqr(Sum(x, n)));
    plot InertiaTS = a * x + b;
}
input length = 20;
plot LinReg1 = Inertia(close, length);
plot LinReg2 = InertiaTS(close, length);
15:45 Mobius: no  it means your use was.  That code works as designed
15:45 AlphaInvestor: Biom - don't Dis der Mobius scripts
15:46 Mobius: I have checked every study and function in TOS - There is only one that doesn't work as purposed   declare once_per_bar
15:48 Biometrizilla: Not dissing, trying to understand. I know that the study works. How is the usage different? I took the code I just posted and put it in a new study. If I plot x it starts at 13 on the first bar. Why does it do that?
15:49 Mobius: My crystal ball is broken. You'll have to post the entire code for me to give a reason
15:50 Mobius: Or you can use AddLabel or plot .Values_Below to deBug your code
15:51 Mobius: There's always a reason. And; 99.99999% of the time it's PEBCAK error
15:52 Mobius: That holds for me too. Not picking on anyone
15:52 thomas7156: Thanks Mobius  I need to do some reading and study on thinkscript coding syntax etc.. I haven't done any coding in the last 30 years and that was basic and early C+. I chanded the top 2 line to input try to get dome feed back from TOS and I posted the chqnged code I changed the inputs back to def and the scan runs bu does not finish or display anything. Further study for sure won't hurt me. I have been retired for 4 years and I have some time to devote to it.  Thanks so much for your help I really apreciate it. I use your and really like your True Momentum Oscillator that someone sent me. Thanks Again I'' be back
15:54 Mobius: thomas  - For some scans it's easier write the scan as a STUDY frist to make sure it's plotting as you want then reference that plot. I find that easiest
16:00 Biometrizilla: Code coming up. I took the inertiaTS off the website, declared it a lower study and put in a plot statement in the script. In this case the x value for the first bar seems to match the length value.
16:00 Biometrizilla: declare lower;
script inertiaTS {
    plot xplot = x;
16:00 Biometrizilla: It has to be operator error but I need to figure out what I'm doing to cause it.
16:04 amalia: Refer to post @hh:50
16:04 Biometrizilla: Then if I take the same code, don't use the script approach and use different equations for calculating slope and intercept, the output matches and this time x for first bar is 13.
16:04 Biometrizilla: declare lower;
input length = 89;
# Incrementing x for each bar moves endpoint each bar
# This duplicates the TOS LinearRegCurve function, which calls Inertia
def x = x[1]+1;
plot XPlot = x;
# Slope & Intercept calculations
def Ex = Sum(x,length);
def Ey = Sum(price,length);
def Exy = Sum(x*price,length);
def Ex2 = Sum(x*x,length);
def Denominator = (length*Ex2) - sqr(Ex);
def Slope = ((length*Exy) - (Ex*Ey)) / Denominator;
def Intercept = ((Ex2*Ey) - (Ex*Exy))/ Denominator;
plot LinearRegCurve = (Slope * x) + Intercept;
LinearRegCurve.setdefaultColor(color.Red);
# Check against TOS built-in Inertia function
plot InertiaTS = Inertia(price,length);
InertiaTS.setdefaultColor(color.Yellow);
16:08 Up_n_Up: don't know if this applies in this case, but in any case you probably should find 'prefetch
16:08 Up_n_Up: in the manual/tutorials and understand the potential impacts
16:10 Up_n_Up: CompoundValue, as was pointed out,, is a more definitive of initializing a variable,
16:10 Up_n_Up: *method* of
16:11 AlphaInvestor: Yeah ... where does it get that first X -  I am sure Biom is assuming the first X is zero ... but why is he assuming that?
16:12 AlphaInvestor: def X = if barnumber() == 1 then 1 else x[1] + 1;      # might work better
16:12 MTS1: Debug the code as suggested already to find out. .
16:13 Biometrizilla: Up_n_Up - that's what I was refering to in my initial question. Prefetch determines an auto-lookback period based on what is going on in the study. I'll investigate this some more. Thanks for pointing me in that direction.
16:14 Biometrizilla: AlphaInvestor - I believe in reading through the material that when discussing recursion it was stated that when you define a variable it starts at zero. But that may not be the case if Prefetching comes into play.
16:14 Mobius: Prefetch isn't used except for infinite impulse ThinkScript Native Studies.
16:14 MTS1: Nope; based on the MA period and type only Bio
16:15 Mobius: You can not call or access prefetch
16:15 Mobius: from thinkScript or any thinkScript function. Only the native studies call it
16:15 MTS1: That's why compoundvalue was suggested.
16:16 Biometrizilla: Past offset is what looks like is the appropriate item. It's on the same page as Prefetch.
16:16 Mobius: native studies and native functions such as
ExpAverage()
Average()
WildersAverage()
16:17 MTS1: Past Offset does not impact 'visible data' which is only data TS has access to.
16:17 Mobius: Although Average isn't an infinite impulse tos does use prefetch so that it plots at the first bar
16:17 bigworm: native blankets
16:18 Mobius: Alrighty then. Time to find something interesting to drink.
16:18 bigworm: jack and coke?
16:18 bigworm: that used to get me into trouble
16:19 Biometrizilla: So I posted the cut and paste from the Inertia definition. Would you expect that x at the first bar would be zero?
16:19 Mobius: I'd never ruin a perfectly good whisky with coke. Yuk
16:19 bigworm: are you saying jack daniels is a good whiskey?
16:20 Mobius: Bio.. I expect nothing I check.  Use SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.Values_Below) and find out
16:20 bigworm: ive been told makers mark is pretty good.  also, they have a cool bottle.
16:21 Mobius: JD is whisky.  Single Barrel is Good and some others are great
16:21 AlphaInvestor: Biom - I would expect it to be some random number pulled out of the air ... because you didn't initialize it
16:22 AlphaInvestor: It MAY work sometimes, but in every case it is Bad Form
16:26 Biometrizilla: Ok. I'll play around with CompoundValue. Plenty of examples in the online information that shows def x = x[1] + 1; as a valid way to do things.
16:27 Mobius: Bio..
def x = x[1] + 1;
def y = compoundValue(1, y[1] + 1, 0);
plot data1 = x;
data1.SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.Values_Below);
plot data2 = y;
data2.SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.Values_Above);
16:33 MTS1: And Bio; remember that we here have no input or control on the manual; just volunteers interested in TS that try to help. The manual is certainly a place to start learn TS or find functions, but when you get answers here and suggestions (and how to) debug to verify what's happening, it is of no value to argue, repeat code examples without debugging, or quote the manual back. .
16:36 AlphaInvestor: Biom - add this as well. You will see that my method, which initializes the first bar using a RECursive variable, also works
def z = if barnumber() == 1 then 0 else z[1]+1;
plot data3 = z;
data3.SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.Values_Below);
16:36 MTS1: (quote the manual back questioning the answers without verifying yourself I meant)
16:43 Mobius: Valid for a use. Like a hammer is valid for a use. But painting a house isn't one of those uses. Sure you could do it but it'd be a lot easier to use a different tool
16:45 Mobius: In Incrementing a variable it may or may not be important to start at 1 or 0.
16:47 Nube: As an example, when I was a lad I washed my mother's car with a rock. A rock is a perfectly good tool, not so much for cleaning mumsie's Cordoba however.
16:48 Nube: "I love what you've done to my Cordoba" was not her response
16:48 Mobius: ha
16:49 Mobius: I did the same sort of thing when Brillo Pads first came out
16:49 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - how did the boat fare after Michael?
16:50 Mobius: No problems. Alpha...  Not anything the bilge pump even had a hard time with  :)
16:52 bigworm: sometimes I acutally laugh out loud at whats said in this room
16:53 bigworm: not just a fake lol but furealz

17:57 dtree: hello gurus
17:57 dtree: need help on configuring scans
17:59 dtree: how can I get alert with stocks that have 3 consecutive 1 minute green candels?
18:01 Up_n_Up: how are you defining green?
18:01 dtree: green close - close > open ? I dont know - guessing
18:02 Up_n_Up: so close higher than open?
18:02 dtree: in that minute yes
18:02 Up_n_Up: sum(close>open,3)==3
18:03 Up_n_Up: that be it.
18:03 Up_n_Up: later folks...
18:04 dtree: do you have a library of scripts I can read
18:05 momo: dtree make sure you select 1 minute aggregation in scan script with that code
18:06 momo: Default is usually D for daily, change that to 1 minute
18:06 dtree: I am compeletely new for this guys - I worked on C# and TSQL
18:07 dtree: basically what i want is - priceline is above VWAP , 20SMA, 50SMA, 200 SMA
18:07 dtree: and when 3 green candlestickes occure I want to get alert
18:08 dtree: please help
18:10 momo: close > VWAP() and close > average(close,20) and close > average(close,50) and close > average(close,200) and sum(close > open,3) == 3
18:11 momo: select 1 minute aggregation in script
18:12 momo: Then you can save scan as watchlist and also create alert on scan
18:13 dtree: would it be possible for you to send me this custome scan? I want to learn from it also , as its going to be the first script for me
18:14 momo: I already wrote it above, copy paste in custom scan
18:15 momo: Call support to guide you through how to use scan feature and they will guide you one on one

05:53 chief: Nube..not sure if he was first but I think rp did it with an indicator called "Edge"
06:18 Nube: Thanks, chief! I will look into that.
06:25 Nube: There's an error in the ToS translation of the Stiffness Indicator in the latest issue of TASC mag. It's effectively the same but has the wrong multiplier for scaling. The accompanying strategy mentioned specific levels which are incorrect in the study version shared in the mag. This version corrects that error.

06:44 Anonymous so far: Is there any documentation on Thinkscript that explains which functions work on the mobile app?
06:45 Nube: Anonymous, no but there are some people here with experience with the mobile app. What question / problem are you having with it?
06:47 Anonymous so far: I have a script which uses addlabel() do display text based on some basic conditions. it works perfectly on desktop platform but nothyis displayed on mobile app
07:07 Nube: Yeah, no string on mobile so label and bubble are no go
07:07 Anonymous so far: oh ok. thanks for clarifying

08:38 JabbaTheCabin: weird that nasdaq is up 62 handles, yet $tick/q is +28
08:40 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: good morning all.
08:40 JabbaTheCabin: hi darryl
08:40 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Hey Jabba
08:41 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I haave a sad song I wrote.  Goes like this:
08:41 JabbaTheCabin: blank verse?
08:42 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: "why o why, did i not play....ebaaaaay....ebaaaaay"
08:42 JabbaTheCabin: lol
08:42 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: sorry hit enter too early
08:43 ameriman: NQ crossed an important low volume node at 7200, don’t think it’s coming back down below it now
08:44 JabbaTheCabin: a rather big up move, nbut so far internals not confiring ,
08:45 ameriman: $ADSPD and $ADNDD internals very strong
08:45 Eedie: gm
08:45 JabbaTheCabin: and /vx is only up .30
08:45 tmoney20g: bt, pull back at 7240 nq ?
08:45 tmoney20g: or hold then continue ?
08:45 tmoney20g: or wait and see
08:46 blondetrader: ideal pullback holds 7185 for more up
08:46 esmal: yooo tmoney
08:47 blondetrader: if it breaks down then would be looking for a LH to sell pref under 7205
08:47 esmal: my bad was helping a coworker whos gonna be taking over for my position
08:47 esmal: but yeah yesterday was decent, wbu?
08:47 JabbaTheCabin: i'm thinking the rug gets pulled out in nasdaq and russell.  s&p looks a little stronger.
08:47 blondetrader: potential on way up nq 7270s and 7310
08:47 AlphaInvestor: Rug pulling is officially banned until further notice
08:48 blondetrader: lol
08:48 ameriman: /NQ internals stronger than /ES internals
08:48 blondetrader: lets just get the new lows over with
08:48 tmoney20g: esmal, out in the field yesterday, couldn't play
08:48 JabbaTheCabin: what internals?
08:48 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: short covering 2.0 ?
08:48 ameriman: Scroll up I already wrote
08:48 JabbaTheCabin: not the tick, not the a/d lines, not the breadth
08:49 invertedhammer: Cl breaks 69.7, 70.13 next
08:49 blondetrader: lets go hammer
08:49 ameriman: /NQ internals stronger than /ES internals
08:49 AlphaInvestor: Liver + kidneys
08:49 blondetrader: that will at least gives us potential for cont up 
08:49 fred__w: bt  my model says it could take a bit longer
08:50 blondetrader: well I am getting anxious now that we r in 2nd 1/2 of oct
08:50 blondetrader: we r still well below where we need to be for strenth into nov
08:51 blondetrader: which messes up my plan lol
08:51 fred__w: bt  i have thot of that  historically  this action doesnt conform exactly
08:51 blondetrader: agreed
08:52 fred__w: ..except in  longer term sense
08:52 fred__w: a longer*
08:52 blondetrader: just need that point where all get back in sync and until then 2 way mkts
08:52 Dixie: +1 bt
08:52 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: RUT, 4 strong green 5m candles
08:53 fred__w: darryl  that just means we're playing in a range  as of now
08:54 Eedie: We need more cowbell
08:54 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: RUT is still way oversold, could get big bounce.
08:55 TnT: 2 way markets, yes!
08:55 Eedie: GM Tnt
08:55 fred__w: darryl  i dont agree  it hit that gap and stalled  
08:56 TnT: gm eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeedie bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbttttttttttttt
08:56 Eedie: Oh no my other brother from another mother.
08:56 Tanya: Hi there Tnt
08:56 TnT: gm Tanya
08:57 JabbaTheCabin: more cowbell, less bullcrap
08:58 TnT: existing home sales coming up
08:59 JabbaTheCabin: probably a good place to short nasdaq and or russell
08:59 Dixie: Will Ferrell (more cowbell) did a great job on SNL
08:59 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: we should get some more volatility, the RUT 40 week weekly average is still sloping up.  and it's oversold.
08:59 fred__w: jabba  im all in  south
09:00 Tanya: Builders complain about high interest rates that caused their sales missed
09:00 lilFish: more cowbell eeee, ha!
09:00 TnT: well Tanya, 30 year mortgage at 5% freaked buyers out
09:00 TnT: it DOES make a difference
09:00 Dixie: John Candy should have been on that show as a regular instead of hosting...
09:01 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: higher IR's affecting home sales in sept.  down 3.4%
09:01 JabbaTheCabin: short nq 20.25
09:01 TnT: 10:00 News Bot: US Existing Home Sales Sep 5.15M vs. Exp. 5.3M (Prev. 5.34M, Rev. 5.33M)
09:01 Precious: I'm not hearing anything
09:02 Tanya: TNT, in 1977 my mortgage was 7 1/2 then in the 80’ much higher than 7 1/2
09:02 Precious: What is going on comrade
09:02 Dixie: mortgage actually means "death contract"
09:03 blondetrader: 1820s-30s adding to amzn BR
09:03 Precious: What do you guys think having margin account. advice please
09:03 fred__w: jabba  for me  it is always russell
09:03 fred__w: precious  im allergic to margin
09:03 Precious: Thanks
09:04 ameriman: As I already warned /NQ internals very strong
09:04 Dixie: Fred +1
09:04 Precious: Thanks Fred
09:04 TnT: yes Tanya, I did a variable rate mortgage at 14.5% in 1982, but it is all about recent rates vs current rising rate, not ancient history
09:04 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Is there a 1X etf for the Russell ?  I know URTY is a 3X.
09:04 blondetrader: 2812 on deck
09:04 blondetrader: warning on rty short term dly getting ovb
09:04 fred__w: np
09:04 blondetrader: nq already there
09:04 TnT: with record high housing prices to boot
09:04 ameriman: I tried to warn, /NQ internals very strong
09:05 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: OVB?
09:05 fred__w: darryl  yes  but i only do the 2x pair
09:05 blondetrader: rty needs over this weeks H for any cont up
09:05 blondetrader: over bought
09:05 Eedie: Over bought
09:05 fred__w: ..maybe one is rwm?  
09:05 Tanya: What is rty stands for?
09:06 blondetrader: its the russell futures
09:06 TnT: /rty is russel index futures
09:06 Eedie: russell thank you..lol
09:06 Tanya: Thanks Tnt
09:06 blondetrader: 87 LIS es
09:07 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: why don't TOS give volume on the averages like RTY/RUT?
09:07 invertedhammer: Cl back test 69.70 then boom
09:07 TnT: RUT is an index, there is no volume
09:07 ameriman: Darryl it does give volume in /RTY
09:07 TnT: /RTYdoes have volume
09:07 blondetrader: 69.9 R cl
09:07 blondetrader: rty rocks
09:08 blondetrader: way better than es for day trades
09:08 ameriman: Darryl and they are not averages, they are indices
09:08 ameriman: And futures
09:08 TnT: NQ is the leader today % wise
09:09 ameriman: Yes I’ve been telling everyone /NQ internals very strong today since open bell
09:09 Bealzybub: Russell is my middle name man lol
09:09 TnT: NQ breadth +89
09:09 fred__w: darryl  i have volume in my index  but im still in experimental mode in its use
09:09 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Is /RTY the same as the Russell 2000 index?
09:10 ameriman: Index doesn’t have volume
09:10 TnT: NO, it is a futures contract
09:10 ameriman: Futures have volume
09:10 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Index, what i meant
09:10 fred__w: darryl  rut/iwm are the main ones  
09:10 blondetrader: BABA @ 148 putting on a PS
09:10 ameriman: /RTY is FUTURES not index
09:11 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: thanks Fred, forgot about IWM!
09:11 ameriman: IWM is ETF
09:11 ameriman: Has volume
09:12 Dixie: A study of markets often reveals that the perfect time to buy was yesterday.
09:12 fred__w: amer  yes  but people use it as a close proxy
09:12 invertedhammer: Rty lowest vol of indices
09:13 lilFish: someone forgot to tell isrg that it beat:)
09:13 ameriman: invertedhammer /RTY is NOT index
09:13 ameriman: It is futures
09:13 TnT: actually not, /EMD has the lowest volume of index futures
09:14 invertedhammer: I know compared to Es and nq
09:14 TnT: /EMD is S&P mid caps
09:14 fred__w: darryl  ahh yes  i recall the iwm/rwm as the 1x pair
09:14 invertedhammer: I trade rty daily
09:15 ameriman: You said “lowest vol of indices”
09:15 fred__w: inverted  for me its the 2x pair
09:15 ameriman: Indices don’t have volume
09:15 TnT: he meant index futures
09:16 invertedhammer: Thxs tnt
09:16 tmoney20g: so nq didn't break 7240, keep testing till it breaks it then to 7280 ?
09:16 mep1976: p&g up over 6
09:16 mep1976: 8%
09:16 tmoney20g: or was that housing data bad ?
09:16 mep1976: lol
09:16 mep1976: what a scam
09:17 TnT: where?
09:17 ameriman: tmoney resistance was 7200 it broke that very early
09:17 mep1976: hey tnt
09:17 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: this is shaping up.  not giving back any morning gains.
09:17 tmoney20g: ya, bt's notes earlier said 7201, then 7240, then 7280
09:17 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: at least not much anyway
09:20 TheOnceAndFuture: only 45 into the day
09:20 ameriman: tmoney 7240 is daily 8 ema
09:20 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Amer, what are ya'll referring to.?
09:21 TheOnceAndFuture: I would assume NQ
09:21 fred__w: tmoney  my model is further south
09:21 ameriman: /NQ
09:21 fred__w: ..but  we'll see
09:22 blondetrader: opened BABA w/ 11/2 145 puts @ 5.2 will add 148 and will put sell puts on @ 143 ish 131
09:23 ameriman: 7228 is now intraday VPOC
09:23 blondetrader: rty 68-65 needs to hold for an 80 test
09:24 TnT: tick charts are sagging
09:24 fred__w: bt  ok  
09:25 blondetrader: 64 break puts 50 and 48 in play
09:25 fred__w: bt  thats closer to my model
09:26 blondetrader: :)
09:26 blondetrader: I try to give small tf and bigger pic
09:26 blondetrader: 88-84 needs to hold es'
09:26 fred__w: ..but i use the uwm index as a proxy
09:26 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: 50% retrace
09:26 blondetrader: how come not rty
09:26 blondetrader: rut
09:26 ameriman: UWM is NOT index
09:26 mep1976: sdpi man can't get pullback
09:27 ameriman: UWM is leveraged ETF
09:27 JabbaTheCabin: nq back below my entry. i was 20 handles too early ;-)
09:27 ameriman: Not index
09:27 fred__w: ive been trading the uwm/twm pair for years  so i use them as proxies
09:27 blondetrader: ahh
09:27 blondetrader: I only do rty and rut options
09:27 fred__w: amer  i use it as my index  and it does well in that role
09:28 invertedhammer: Ameriman we hear u
09:28 TheOnceAndFuture: -_-
09:28 TnT: NLT -490

09:29 fred__w: amer  have fun with your beliefs  ill have fun with moine
09:29 TheOnceAndFuture: To him it "works as an index". Whatever, it's his money.

09:35 fred__w: amer  fyi  i do recognize my proxy is a deriviative  i just see it as adequate as an index as well for my purposes
09:36 TheOnceAndFuture: Fred, if it's what you really believe, why defend it so much?
09:36 TheOnceAndFuture: We get it. Hope it continues to work out.
09:37 fred__w: once  every trader has his own adopted position  im just stating mine

09:31 JAtrader: hi guys gm
09:32 JAtrader: have a ques. Is there a way to allow custom studys to send alert to email instead of making an alarm sound? whats the code?
09:33 Mobius: JA.. Use the custom study as a Dynamic Scan where MarketWatch Alerts can be set
09:33 JohnnyQuotron: nube.. if you can think of a more precise method than my range method  (highestAll high lowest all low) to keep the arrows and squares aligned i would love to hear it.
09:34 JAtrader: Mobius not sure if i understand. Use it under the scan tab, is that what ur saying?
09:34 JAtrader: alerts tab does not allow me to set emails alerts for custom study
09:35 Mobius: I'm saying - Use the custom study as a Dynamic Scan where MarketWatch Alerts can be set.  Use the manual and lookup Dynamic Scans and Alerts for them
09:36 JAtrader: ok
09:57 JohnnyQuotron: Mobius... if you have the time, what might i read that would help me understand the betaDev variable in your Gaussian RSI LaGurerre?  Something without too many big scary words.
09:58 amalia: lol
10:00 JohnnyQuotron: morning amalia :)
10:07 AlphaInvestor: Some folks were asking about Stoplight last night, but then were posting things that were not Stoplightish ... Stoplight (as done by multiple authoures) is a lower study. What peeps seemed to be asking about was Meters not lights. Here is an example of a Strength Meter
# BWD_TrendStrengthMeter ToS Study
# Author: BigWaveDave
# Version:  1.7
# Release Date:  6/27/14
# No guarantees as to accuracy expressed or implied
# Use at your own discretion
# Usage:
#    Run on any chart... best on 2min and 15min charts, however.
# 
# Version 1.7 Changes
# ===================
#    + Fixed issue with meter not displaying correctly after another TOS update.
# Version 1.6 Changes
#    + Fixed issue with meter not displaying correctly after TOS update.
# Version 1.5 Changes
#    + Added another settings option to use a fixed color background for the
#        ADX value label.  Some people had difficulty reading the value
#        depending upon their chart background color.  Sadly, I've hit a bug
#        in TOS and can't make the value editable via the Study Settings.  To
#        change the fixed background color, you'll need to manually edit the
#        RGB values below ADXBkgndValueR, ADXBkgndValueG, and ADXBkgndValueB
# Version 1.4 Changes
#    + Based on excellent suggestions, modifed to draw ADX value background
#        in same color as currently active segment.
# Version 1.3 Changes
#    + Optionally turn off then meter to view only the ADX value.
# Version 1.2 Changes
#    + Added display of ADX value option.
# Version 1.1 Changes
#    + Fixed logic error causing dropped segments.
# Version 1.0 Changes
#    + Initial release.  Feedback requested.

10:10 JohnnyQuotron: Thank you Alpha.  That will give me something to chew on.  And to be clear.  StopLights are lower studies.  Strength Meters are upper studies?
10:19 AlphaInvestor: Well, all the
10:20 mthfr_vaxxed: well thats cool. thanks alpha.
10:21 Mobius: The name Stop Lights started years ago when the subject of Combined Signal Approach was first introduced to this group. A way to look at three different studies all signaling an entry at the same time.  Someone said "It's like a stop light" with all the red green and yellow point colors in a row. The name stuck. That was when this chat room first opened. I was here that day and it wasn't long after that when the subject was opened
10:21 AlphaInvestor: Well, all the Stoplight studies that I have from ChrisBell, LAR, and Dilbert are lower studies, or lower study "like" studies pushed to the upper
10:23 JohnnyQuotron: Thank you, I have changed the Tab to read;  Stop Lights & Strength Meters
10:25 JohnnyQuotron: Fruit Loops and FooBars are among my favorite manes.  Alpha if you could share the "Dilbert" stoplight that would be great.  It is not in the OneNote.
10:26 Nube: The HoHo Squeeze is still my favoriten

09:56 ameriman: Amalia +10
09:57 chenmann: hence i m so interested
09:57 ameriman: Index Arbitrage trading needs huge size so only institutions can do it and it’s a gold mine for them
09:57 The100yearBULL: oh wow, hey guys
09:58 tmoney20g: hi
09:58 fred__w: ..im only vying for replacing expenses
09:58 fred__w: ..if things get better than that  great
09:59 blondetrader: well stopped on rty but now know
09:59 chenmann: if any one can figure out a way for small players to play index arbitrage, i will pay u
09:59 tmoney20g: nq 7300 go go
09:59 tmoney20g: make it a nice friday
09:59 chenmann: been trying and no luck
09:59 fred__w: chen  thats not me
09:59 The100yearBULL: chenmann you should come work for me as a recruiter
09:59 chenmann: haha
09:59 chenmann: crooks play ground
10:00 ameriman: Chen the problem is there is a symbol which tells you the arbitrage differential value between index and futures and that symbol is not available on TOS and regular brokerages
10:00 ameriman: You need that symbol to do arbitrage trading
10:00 TnT: you can do that yourself on TOS, for example, /YM-$DJI
10:00 JabbaTheCabin: got stopped on nq short, took 14 points
10:00 ameriman: Then all you do is put on a mean reversion study on symbol
10:01 JohnnyStocks: Where is the "TV Gadget"?
10:01 amalia: Tculs, was I just censored for posting Buy /YM?
10:01 ameriman: And do mean reversion trading when differential high
10:01 TnT: hit + sign to add, lower left corner
10:01 amalia: Buy /YM
10:02 fred__w: chen  a guiding princople for me is  if you are x long and x short to start  and one side goes to 2x  the othe to 0.5x  then  your 2x becomes 2.5x
10:02 admin_tculs: amalia   my apologies  fat finger
10:02 amalia: wtf. I posted that at hh:59
10:02 amalia: All is well :)
10:02 amalia: You should buy /YM tho
10:03 chenmann: i got censored....crooks in the room
10:03 TnT: I have never been censored accidently, it was always on purpose
10:03 chenmann: ha
10:03 amalia: lol
10:03 JohnnyStocks: Anyone know where the TV Gadget is?
10:04 TnT: I just told you above, lower left + sign

10:07 amalia: Hope you read my reply to you, JohnnyStocks
10:07 blondetrader: I flipped on rty after stopping out
10:07 lilFish: dude lower left
10:07 blondetrader: this is so far petering out
10:07 amalia: Careful going long when bt going against you
10:07 ameriman: Chen all you need is fair value (FV) of index versus futures, then when FV is at a 2 or 3 SD distance then do mean reversion trading
10:07 JohnnyStocks: I don't see that page, tnt
10:07 amalia: Damit
10:07 blondetrader: lol well so far I am like a puppy
10:08 amalia: I have a ReverseStopOrder handy

10:11 Bid_Ask: then use up/down arrows
10:11 Bid_Ask: might be higher/lower
10:11 TnT: no, live support above, you need help
10:11 amalia: JOHNNYSTOCKS!!!!!!!!!
10:11 mthfr_vaxxed: whats up with PLAG? why are china based us listed stocks surging?
10:11 amalia: Hi.

10:12 ameriman: So he cannot see the + symbol
10:12 amalia: Nor me
10:12 ameriman: Open the left panel on main window
10:12 tmoney20g: bt, based on today so far, where do you see nq ending up ?
10:13 blondetrader: while over 7200 there is a good shot at 7270s
10:14 blondetrader: if it cant hold and 7180 gets taken out.....7055
10:14 blondetrader: mind u a close under top # NG for nq intro next week
10:14 amalia: #TeamWideStops
10:15 tmoney20g: i like the 7270 idea better
10:15 tmoney20g: lol
10:15 TheOnceAndFuture: Anyone else bearish on NFLX into 2019?
10:15 blondetrader: well nflx bearish def to psl
10:16 blondetrader: esp under 358
10:16 TheOnceAndFuture: "PSI"?
10:16 blondetrader: close over may give it room to move a bit higher like 370
10:16 blondetrader: prior swing low
10:17 invertedhammer: Short rty 66.9
10:18 blondetrader: welcome
10:18 blondetrader: now we can go to 50 together
10:18 TheOnceAndFuture: Thanks BT
10:19 blondetrader: rty remains the weakset link
10:19 blondetrader: :)
10:19 invertedhammer: Sounds good
10:21 Bealzybub: Might be a silly question but does anyone think some of this volatility is in part due to the upcoming election?
10:22 blondetrader: yes
10:22 amalia: Ffffffffffffffffffffffffffff....bt
10:22 blondetrader: no one else does tho so what do I know
10:22 blondetrader: lol ama
10:22 JabbaTheCabin: here comes the selloff
10:22 fred__w: beal  everything is built into price  imo
10:22 amalia: Why don’t you ever join me in a trade? Maybe MsMarket will listen if we’re on the same side
10:22 TheOnceAndFuture: Elections should be worked in Bealzy
10:23 radon224: now bt, I've talked about the election volatility for days now
10:23 blondetrader: sorry ama I tried and got spanked
10:23 ameriman: Amalia the prisoners dilemma will never let that happen
10:23 TheOnceAndFuture: Un;ess repubs keep the majoirty
10:23 ameriman: join same side
10:23 Bealzybub: As in its main effect are already boughtin?
10:23 blondetrader: well yes radon.....you and me
10:23 blondetrader: I think outcome so uncertain and mkt doesnt like not knowing
10:24 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: the RTY went in the toilet
10:24 blondetrader: lots riding on it more so than normal jimo
10:24 radon224: exactly, the final result does not matter
10:24 radon224: it's the not knowing part
10:24 blondetrader: rty canary in coal mine
10:24 TheOnceAndFuture: In my opinion the market will only react if repubs keep majority. Politicians arounf the board expect dems to take majoirty
10:24 Bealzybub: Thats what I would think blonde but I'm kinda a newb as it applies to that.
10:24 fred__w: beal  weve been needing a real correction for a while now  and this is the typical time corrections come
10:25 blondetrader: imo rep keeping control and a china deal swings us to new highs
10:25 Bealzybub: We all voting red?
10:25 radon224: don't
10:25 blondetrader: lol
10:25 radon224: go there
10:25 TheOnceAndFuture: lol
10:25 blondetrader: but yes shhhh
10:25 fred__w: beal  i ignore politics in here
10:26 Bealzybub: Ok, I get it.
10:26 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I'm voting for GREEN
10:26 radon224: It' not even a discussion for family during Thanksgiving, much less a trading chat room, imo
10:26 fred__w: ..leads to exclusion  :)
10:26 streetglide: OnceandFuture.....election is not baked in
10:26 blondetrader: nq close to moment of truth
10:26 blondetrader: haha radon...peeps take their opinions way too seriously
10:26 Mark: Money is not showing in my account balance. It left my bank account? Any help thanks !
10:27 AlphaInvestor: I leave when politics gets discussed in here ... Goodbye
10:27 amalia: Mark, contact support@thinkorswim.com and let them know of the issue.

10:27 amalia: =p <3
10:27 streetglide: lol, bt
10:27 blondetrader: I get a headache
10:27 Bealzybub: I shall refrain. Wasnt meaning to bring anything "political" in, just as it applies to the volatility
10:27 blondetrader: well I think its important Beal
10:28 amalia: We haven’t even started talking politics and it’s already bad. lol
10:28 Mark: Mhm
10:28 TheOnceAndFuture: Not really talking politics, we're talking how they might affect the market
10:28 Mark: Thanks Amalia
10:28 amalia: And it’s already bad. lol
10:28 TheOnceAndFuture: lol 
10:28 blondetrader: look bottom line I dont think mkt will like impeach repeal talk
10:28 streetglide: mrs.street hates politics, but keep trying to tell her its important to keep up
10:28 radon224: It goes downhill quickly, trust me
10:29 blondetrader: mr BT too street
10:29 blondetrader: he likes sports...yawn
10:29 streetglide: she lives in happy bubble
10:29 Kidd: Peep IPCI
10:29 Bealzybub: Well, I'm about two ticks from going green lol
10:29 radon224: Given the recent market action, today doesn't seem very bullish to me, even with the "upness"
10:29 chenmann: invertedhammer, nice trade rty....got a target?
10:30 streetglide: stros suc, chen
10:30 chenmann: sorry
10:30 JabbaTheCabin: if you want to know what the street thinks of the election, look no further than what is being priced into the option market.
10:30 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I get the feeling these "premarket" moves are designed to suck you in
10:30 blondetrader: ^^
10:30 streetglide: didnt bring their sticks
10:30 mthfr_vaxxed: indeed
10:30 invertedhammer: Ty. 50 then 42
10:30 radon224: this move happened after the open
10:31 radon224: today that is
10:31 chenmann: kate upton s gonna dump verlander
10:31 streetglide: lol
10:31 radon224: and it's monthly OPEX

10:31 radon224: lol
10:31 chenmann: lol
10:31 radon224: me first
10:32 amalia: If anyone’s counting a non rolling year of a bear market like 2015, we’ve got 6 more months of volatility. Last ATH drop was -15.57%. ATH-15.57% in /YM now equates to 22767ish.
10:32 blondetrader: es coming into moment of truth
10:32 TheOnceAndFuture: I swear the reporter on CNBC just said "bong market"
10:32 TheOnceAndFuture: Instead of "bond"
10:32 streetglide: seema?
10:32 blondetrader: nice ama
10:33 JabbaTheCabin: maybe it was the bong market in canada
10:33 TheOnceAndFuture: Yeah Seema
10:33 streetglide: Pat Benatar.....shadow room.....crank it
10:33 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: If this mkt doesn't hold ya'll know what that means right?
10:34 blondetrader: new lows 
10:34 radon224: I've got Coheed & Cambria "Ten Speed" rocking on the speakers.
10:34 blondetrader: I feel like a parrot

10:36 blondetrader: took the calls $$ to offset buying puts
10:36 JabbaTheCabin: sure
10:36 JabbaTheCabin: i've done  them before but have never really worked all that well for me.
10:36 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: glad i got out of URTY. Took small loss.
10:37 blondetrader: well my out lay was 1/3 more than prem taken in...I can live with that
10:37 blondetrader: atm I am pretty confident at a min we retest lows

10:39 JabbaTheCabin: love is never on time. Anyone who is married knows this.
10:39 blondetrader: ha
10:40 Nube: Johhny, your methodfro aligning those squares is about as good as any I've run across. If you give yourself some expansion area you can then move the line a little above or below the price plot but that's the only additional option I know of
10:47 dennis1711: Jonny- Is that a public tab?

11:17 dennis1711: I have a general question about time frame data in TOS.  In the chat window pane, TOS alows me to select specific aggregation periods (1h, 1d, etc) and a specific time interval (1d, 1 w, 1 year, 5 y, etc) for that aggregation.  Howver, the time interval is limited in drop down box.  For exapmle, a one hour aggregation can only go out 365 days.   I'd like to test a strategy beyond 365 days.  Is there an override or work around?
11:18 bigworm: hey mobius do quant funds only hire from the best schools?
11:19 AlphaInvestor: Dennis - test this past year, then set specific dates and test last yar

11:25 mthfr_vaxxed: bigworm : no
11:26 mthfr_vaxxed: lots of factors involved. write public jupyter notebooks on github teaching what you learn and that'll be enough probably to get you in
11:27 bigworm: so write my code and post on github?
11:27 mthfr_vaxxed: also that max dama pdf details a lot too
11:27 mthfr_vaxxed: yes... quants are weird that they want everything secret. coders want everything open source. find the middle ground.
11:28 Nube: XLB has had a rough week. I think that's gotta be on the list of things to short on a bounce
11:28 bigworm: i was looking last night in new york
11:29 mthfr_vaxxed: also research your funds... some are friendly. some are stuck up. dont blast out a resume and accept first offer. you'll waste time.

11:27 blondetrader: tony FB going to follow the mkt in general imo
11:27 JabbaTheCabin: Majic - if you want to buy a stock, and you have earnings coming up, you have 2 choices. Either wait till the earnings before buying, or take advantage of heightened volatiliy now  and sell 1 put contract for every 100 shares you want to buy. If the stock goes up, you will make some money. If it goes down below your strike price,, you will get put the stock, albeit at a discount
11:27 tony: what i was thinking
11:27 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: yes, mega will be close to 1B
11:28 ameriman: chen retest in progress
11:28 tmoney20g: what

11:45 Mobius: That study can be pushed to the upper chart by changing the upper plot location.  See note in study
11:46 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - all chart aggregations?
11:48 inbuffalo: This is from Mobius's Supertrend
AddChartBubble(close crosses below ST and bubbles, low[1], AsPrice(low[1]), color.pink);
What do I have to add so that the bubble only shows the last occurrence
Thanks
11:49 AlphaInvestor: CanadianInBuffalo - just zoom in until only one shows
11:50 inbuffalo: Thats too easy AI
11:50 AlphaInvestor: Simple is best
11:51 Mobius: Alpha.. As long as the Zscore is set to current and not an intraday value yes all aggregations
11:51 AlphaInvestor: Thx
11:53 AlphaInvestor: BTW - those look more like Porshe Dots, not stoplights
11:53 Mobius: Porshe Dots came out after those studies. Carter does like his own name
11:54 AlphaInvestor: ;-)
11:54 Nube: I for one am shocked someone appropriate an idea from this room. Shocked, I say.
11:54 Mobius: We were building those when this chat window first opened
11:54 nextrade: the first that i recall seeing red-light /  green-light -was when that system was being plastered all over TV years ago. But you had to be wize to trade .
11:55 Mobius: wisdom still works.
11:56 nextrade: i don't think their in business anymore
11:57 Mobius: At any rate - The idea is not making the indicator Multicolinear and using several in different aggregations.
11:57 nextrade: '' you just wait for the light to turn green-and you buy-then sell when the light turns red ''
11:58 nextrade: that might be why their out of business
11:58 AlphaInvestor: This is what ChrisBell's original stoplight looked like
11:59 Mobius: you still have to know what the green and red is telling you.
11:59 Mobius: don't know chris Bell and hadn't seen that.

11:46 futs: FDA says SUBOXONE is deterrent becaus eit has naloxone in it which is the deterrent
11:46 futs: FDA never says buprenorphine is deterrent

11:51 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: No there are exactly 365 days in year.  No extra hours.
11:51 AlphaInvestor: Dennis - the data length for each chart aggegation is listed in the Manual

12:36 GQ: Hello room anybody have any thoughts on CATS earnings tues am?
12:36 GQ: Down over 20% from high of 172
12:37 lilFish: bar set low
12:38 radon224: CAT made a big investment in gowing sales in China.  Investors are fearful for obvious reasons.
12:39 GQ: Can they beat both lines? I’m in the hole right now
12:00 AlphaInvestor: LAR's original stuff references ChrisBell as the originator
12:01 Mobius: Solomon said " To the writing of books there is no end. And reading them is tiresome." Same applies to indicators.
12:01 AlphaInvestor: but, I am sure many had hands in the pie back then
12:01 Mobius: Lar was late to that party. He'd not been in here when we started writing those.  
12:02 AlphaInvestor: where is Lar these days (and yes I di know his curent handle)
12:02 Mobius: IDK.  Haven't seen him in a while
12:03 AlphaInvestor: haven't seen Dilbert around either
12:04 Mobius: Dilbert was talking about property rentals
12:04 nextrade: last year he was talking about getting into flipping houses
12:04 Mobius: Been there, done that, have the tee shirt
12:05 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - ah yes, money pit management
12:05 nextrade: i saved the eviction notices- to remind me of the pain of being a landlord
12:05 Mobius: I'm starting to see a pattern in the Market. Anyone else picking it up?
12:05 AlphaInvestor: I think I am seeing that pattern in my portfolio
12:06 Nube: Sell everything that hints at rebound
12:06 Mobius: yeah - Ouch
12:06 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - do you have a spare room, or should I reserve a space under the bridge
12:06 bigworm: lol
12:06 Mobius: Got a boat all outfitted and ready to sail  :)
12:07 AlphaInvestor: Nube seems to have taken Dilbert's place ... a producive coder with great ideas
12:08 Nube: Scripting too much. Had a target hit on /6B that I intended to hold over the weekend. Thought about moving it and then thought "nah,  I'll finish this first"
12:08 AlphaInvestor: now, if he would just finish that 78 bar POC, VAH, VAL study
12:08 JohnnyQuotron: my 2cents... last two days we fell into the london close.. rallied into the close... is that what you are seeing?
12:08 Nube: Got taken out green but now I'm out of a trade I wanted to be and have no good reentry spot.
12:09 Nube: This means the Pound is going to the moon Monday
12:09 AlphaInvestor: London Calling .... The Clash
12:09 Nube: Jack The Ripper let loose on the markets
12:09 JohnnyQuotron: I remember those days  And the hangovers.
12:09 Mobius: Phases of a Coder:
1) Bashes Head to learn
2) Light comes on
3) Prolifically pumps out code one idea after another
4) Realizes everything he's done has been done and abandon
5) Bashes head for learning to code
12:09 Nube: ES does have an awful pertty bear flag going
12:10 Nube: Getting to stage 5
12:10 Nube: "Mobius Already Wrote Everything" is stage 4 in ThinkScript
12:11 Mobius: You don't see me getting in someones way.  No way to stop a newly empowered coder from running to what's already been done. 
12:12 Mobius: And sooner or later they do find what they will actually use. Until one day you just look at the chart and damn, you don't need the code anymore.
12:12 AlphaInvestor: 
6) learns which studies really fit your trading style
7) pares down chart to only 15 indicators
8) realizes that 15 indicators leads to Analysis Paralysis
9) pares down chart to a) the ORB, b) RSI_Laguerre, c) Fractal Pivots
10) finally becomes consistently protitable
12:13 Nube: <---- Still can't use Laguerre.
12:14 JohnnyQuotron: what about SuperPivots?
12:14 Nube: SuperPivots would be a good Big Picture
12:14 AlphaInvestor: JQkpa - dats just one man's take on mobius FractalPivots
12:14 Mobius: Laguerre is just another garden variety polynomial
12:15 JohnnyQuotron: I like gardens
12:15 AlphaInvestor: hmmm - there are no Garden Variety polynomials - there arent' even any garden variety uninomials
12:17 Nube: I think my inability to use Laguerre is that it's better suited for a more patient trader.
12:18 Mobius: Best traders have the patience of an oyster
12:18 Nube: I think if a person is more comfortable buying a little carnage or has a longer time frame then it's likely the correct, dirt simple line to follow
12:18 AlphaInvestor: Mmmm I love oysters, lightly steamed is best
12:18 bigworm: and nice pants
12:22 inbuffalo: stay away from the praire oysters if you go out west
12:22 JohnnyQuotron: Are they less slimy when lightly steamed?
12:23 JohnnyQuotron: the oysters not the pants...
12:24 bigworm: i bet lightly steamed pants feel good in the winter
12:24 Nube: They can't taste worse than oysters
12:26 Nube: sardines and mackerel, packed in a tin for several months to several years. That's the good stuff.
12:28 JohnnyQuotron: sardines, pickle and cheese wiz on white bread.. before hazing was taboo
12:40 Nube: Dollar / Yen looks to me like it's  in trouble
12:47 TICKZ: Hi, Anyone have a elliowave studie they can share?
12:40 GQ: Did great with PG today
12:42 GQ: Thinking of taking a loss before earnings ? Any thoughts???

12:58 TnT: a few shots of whiskey makes charts look amazing
12:59 featherweight: Meeep
12:59 RandomDan: NFLX... that's a surprise.
12:59 RandomDan: Definitely didn't see that coming.
13:03 Nube: Alpha, you got a copy of your momersion handy?
13:35 John1a: Anybody has a buffer after Alpha posted "Kind of Stoplight"? Thank you.
13:36 AlphaInvestor: JQkpa - steamed oysters are not slimy at all, lightly steamed are in between - best or both worlds
13:36 BookProfits: Hey fellow traders, need assistance with writing a simple thinkscripts formula. How would I  write the net change of the price of one stock divided by the net change of another?
13:36 AlphaInvestor: Nube - I shared AI_Momersion yesterday, no soup for you
13:41 Nube: Book, what is the math for that?
13:46 BookProfits: Not sure. In this example, its the net change of $DIA (.80) divided by net change of $SPY (.03).
13:48 John1a: Nube:  http://tos.mx/TNYLaj#
