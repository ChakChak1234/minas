10:28 invertedhammer: Missed cl off 67
10:29 RandomDan: Vol yes that is what I think as well.
10:29 invertedhammer: Like to see 2700 back test
10:30 RandomDan: The reason I was doubting the rally today (and still hardly confident), is that I had the same theory yesterday, that who would dump so violently in front of goog, amzn earnings, at least as far as /nq is concerned.
10:31 RandomDan: but dump they did, with a wrecking ball
10:31 tmoney20g: selling begets more selling
10:32 Eedie: It’s fubar but go with the flow
10:32 fred__w: ..and it may be that intraday isnt the important volume to take note of
10:33 chenmann: if u just read back the chats this morning its really funny...haha
10:33 RandomDan: I am looking at /vx cowering in the lower right corner
10:33 chenmann: i have no idea where the markets gonna do....none of us do
10:33 RandomDan: I joined late.
10:34 tmoney20g: pull the rug
10:34 stockhawk: My 5 hourly bars tell me a reversal below the 2700 area should occur. I am observing.

10:46 blondetrader: yes fred
10:46 radon224: Wait, I thought you were on Plan C this morning, you switched?
10:47 chenmann: lol
10:47 blondetrader: lol radon
10:47 vipin123: amzn results will  giive some big move
10:47 fred__w: radon  it is wise to always have a plan B  and even C  no one knows the future
10:47 RandomDan: I am definitely closing out a few things by EOD, but not sure what to open, if anything
10:47 DrHouse: So far rebound Thursday looking Gucci
10:47 stockhawk: my 5 hourly bar pattern tells me we will go lower  between now and 09:30 pacific time. Just thought I 'll share :)
10:47 blondetrader: nothing stks included are where I am convinced this drop isnt over
10:48 chenmann: we r all at the mercy of the algos.....
10:48 streetglide: stealth buying
10:48 blondetrader: but we do have that timing issue
10:48 VolCrush: plan B, plan B, we dont need no stinkin plan B
10:48 blondetrader: promised short term lows today/tomorrow
10:48 RandomDan: I agree blonde, but "they" want to hurt retail shorts today me thinks
10:49 blondetrader: lots of put buyers on tomorrow exp r sad
10:49 vipin123: @blonde agree, one final shakeup low
10:50 RandomDan: yeah I have not been able to buy back my TSLA put at a sensible price yet.
10:50 blondetrader: right so if that the case where do we need to hold on pullbacks
10:50 streetglide: might be panic buying vip
10:51 fred__w: looks like buyers may be drying up  on the 5min
10:51 radon224: Trying to swing trade this is like sticking your hand in a meat grinder
10:51 bobospy: hahhahai
10:51 chenmann: ^^
10:51 bobospy: true 
10:51 streetglide: slowed to a crawl
10:51 fred__w: radon  thats why im a position trader
10:52 RandomDan: fred the /vx doesn't have any energy
10:52 RandomDan: new high goog
10:52 RandomDan: gs, srpt
10:52 first: Anyone know what happened to AMD?
10:52 streetglide: definitely not a v bottom
10:53 TheOnceAndFuture: Nothing
10:53 TheOnceAndFuture: AMD was $10 less than a year ago
10:53 TheOnceAndFuture: What did you people honestly expect?
10:53 tmoney20g: what do you mean by "you people"
10:53 first: It’s like $19
10:53 RandomDan: yep, huge run
10:53 TheOnceAndFuture: The AMD bulls
10:53 first: Will AMD go up again?
10:54 TheOnceAndFuture: From here? maybe
10:54 TheOnceAndFuture: I'd wait until we know more about the state of the market in general
10:54 bobospy: AMD got shot in the foot 
10:55 first: The market is not stable .... one day is down and the next day is up
10:55 vipin123: time for amd to come back to early teens
10:55 TheOnceAndFuture: Agreed @vip
10:55 first: Everyone thought AMD would go up from the Q3 earning yesterday
10:55 streetglide: AMD will be fine as long as Su stays there
10:55 TheOnceAndFuture: not "everyone"
10:55 bobospy: weres alpha ? 
10:56 first: Well, I think AMD is definitely fine
10:56 TnT: he is on a trip to canada
10:56 bobospy: ah that sounds nice 
10:56 fred__w: first  sorry  but the trend is down  clearly
10:56 TnT: too f cold for me
10:56 first: Unless we don’t use electronic devices
10:56 RandomDan: amd? 16, 17, something like that, not low teens
10:56 TheOnceAndFuture: AMD isn't as good of a value stock as a lot of other tech names
10:56 bobospy: im in boston about the same temp 
10:56 blondetrader: tnt 
10:56 blondetrader: you didnt say it today
10:57 first: It’s down for now... it’s normal.... big jumped big dropped
10:57 streetglide: Art not impressed with the buyers
10:57 chenmann: Su said : tradewar is an opportunity!
10:57 first: It’s like not amazon or Facebook
10:57 chenmann: very nice
10:57 streetglide: I like her
10:57 TheOnceAndFuture: Yeah, it's not as valuable lol
10:57 streetglide: she smart
10:57 radon224: Art just wants to get back to the strip club for the lunch buffet
10:58 TheOnceAndFuture: It was run up all of 2017 by millis
10:58 streetglide: lol
10:58 streetglide: martini lunch
10:58 YClan: Manic market... up/down but overall a down-trend to sideways type of action jackson !
10:58 TheOnceAndFuture: We're going to bounce soon, short term
10:58 first: It’s like at&t and Tmobile
10:58 streetglide: I wish AMD would have gotten down in the 15's
10:58 first: Do you use Tmobile or AT&T ?
10:58 TheOnceAndFuture: I'll buy AMD @ 13
10:59 chenmann: i wanted to close my eyes and short everything yesterday, when i should close my eyes and buy .....lol.....always happens that way
10:59 fred__w: yclan  i dont see this as manic  its perfectly orderly  there is a channel we are in
10:59 first: Amd is small company ... it has a long journey, it doesn’t mean it’s gonna stay there
10:59 TheOnceAndFuture: Exactly
10:59 blondetrader: i think moar coffee in order
10:59 YClan: first,   I stopped using my cellphone.  I'm the only guy in here who gave it using one, everywhere I go !
10:59 first: I will buy a lot when it gets to 13
10:59 streetglide: more too, bt
10:59 tmoney20g: moarrrrrrrrrr
11:00 TheOnceAndFuture: MOAR
11:00 TheOnceAndFuture: moar gainz
11:00 stockhawk: Yclan> market will decline between now and 09:30 am, be patient:)
11:00 YClan: moar riskit for the biscuit
11:00 first: I’m currently using the chat room on my cellphone
11:01 tmoney20g: very good
11:01 RandomDan: me too
11:01 YClan: I think, in general.... the uncertainity about Nov elections is part of what is driving the general downtrend/worry.
11:02 TheOnceAndFuture: iunno, GOOGL, AMZN, and INTC earnings are too tempting for people
11:02 TheOnceAndFuture: I think we'll end green and go into tomorrow strong
11:02 radon224: wow, GE getting beat up
11:03 YClan: radon,  I did not think that was possible (GE)
11:03 RandomDan: oh wow... forgot about ge since I got out
11:03 YClan: I think Alpha had a heart attack when he won that Mega Billiune.
11:04 RandomDan: if it gets back to $11.24 I am buying again
11:04 first: 11,24??
11:04 YClan: PowerBawl is at $750 million.  
11:05 first: for AMD?
11:05 first: powerball is probbaly will go up 1 billion again
11:06 RandomDan: GE
11:06 RandomDan: I don't see AMD near $11.24 unless the whole market crashes
11:06 TheOnceAndFuture: Might get some additional chop into next week up to elections and then small recovery into January
11:07 TheOnceAndFuture: Quote me on that
11:07 TnT: /LBS traded below $300, wow
11:07 YClan: Looks like Pawt Stawks are leading the bounce today.  Pawt, Tek, and the Bankster gangsters all in sync upward today.
11:07 first: I think will definiely go up
11:07 TnT: AI will jump out window if he sees /LBS
11:07 first: amd will definiely go up
11:08 first: it's too low for AMD....they made a tons of money, and the martket price is too low
11:08 YClan: TNT,  you would think that would help the home builders... lower cost of goods?   I still see a ton of home building around my neck of the mossy woods.
11:09 TnT: but to build homes requires buyers, higher rates affecting buyers
def d = 1;
plot p = volume[d] > 10000 
         AND lowest(low, 3) > 1.00
         AND highest(high, 3) < 200;
11:10 YClan: MAGA doing well, about 4% up today   (msft, amzn, goog, aapl)
11:10 RandomDan: bankster gangsters? Just some much maligned hard workin' folks trying to make an honest living, trying to make the rent (of the jet, but still) like the rest of us.
11:10 vipin123: fang stocks will be in perpetual bull run for next 20-30 years
11:11 vipin123: every other stock will have a cycle and bust itself every 5 years.
11:11 stockhawk: vipin> that is quiet a statement :)
11:11 YClan: vipin,   FB might be the dragging anchor.. especially if Gov't start more regulating of it/ads, etc.
11:12 vipin123: regulation is good, it just makes fb a  sole player in that segment. no new player will get in due to overhead costs
11:12 VolCrush: welp round nums on the indeces seem to be R atm
11:12 tim0707: Why is TWTR up 15%?
11:12 tmoney20g: earnings
11:12 tmoney20g: conf call
11:12 tmoney20g: etc
11:12 Peter: Why has Facebook become so undesired ? Everyone uses it and it makes so much money
11:13 YClan: Speaking of FB.. how come they are not in the Dow Jones 30??   There are something like 2.5 billion accounts which is 1/3 of the entire world population.  Is that not broad enough to be in the Dow ???
11:13 tmoney20g: kids don't use it anymore
11:13 tmoney20g: only old fogies now
11:13 tmoney20g: however kids are on the gram, and they are the gram
11:13 chenmann: wow the man who called this correction see a red wave
11:13 tim0707: AMZN earnings? Anyone long?
11:14 YClan: chen,  a politacal red/repub wave, or a red/downtrend wave ??
11:14 chenmann: political red wave
11:14 RandomDan: I don't use FB. Lots of millenials don't either. Teenagers even less.
11:15 vipin123: Random, the ones that use are addicted to it, which brings them money
11:15 blondetrader: but they have problems
11:16 YClan: :41 News Bot: Atlanta Fed cuts Q3 GDP forecast to 3.6% (prev. 3.9%)
11:16 TheOnceAndFuture: Lots of people moved from FB to IG, which FB owns anyway
11:17 radon224: Fed Vice-Chair gonna spoil the party here
11:17 RandomDan: yeah but the kids are on snap
11:17 YClan: 30 News Bot: US EIA- Nat Gas, Change Bcf w/e 58bcf vs. Exp. 51.0bcf (Prev. 81.0bcf)
11:17 TheOnceAndFuture: no one is on snap ovver ig anymore
11:17 stockhawk: blondetrader> we are slowly approaching 09:30 am pacific time and my 5 hourly bar pattern seems to be nearing prediction:)
11:17 TheOnceAndFuture: IMO
11:17 YClan: :30 News Bot: US Nat Gas-EIA Implied Flow w/e 63bcf (Prev. 81.0bcf)
11:17 TheOnceAndFuture: IG has all snap features now
11:18 YClan: hawk,    what does that mean?
11:18 vipin123: you guys forgot whatsapp is owned by fb. they still havent started to monetise it. a billion+ whatsapp users
11:19 blondetrader: just not sure how many ways peeps need to communicate
11:19 TheOnceAndFuture: heh
11:19 stockhawk: yclan> it's a sell pattern. we should reverse back down
11:19 tmoney20g: pull the rug
11:20 YClan: vipin,  But WhatsApp was already infiltrated by mainland chinese gov't who were hacking/recording everything sent on WhatApp.  That will move people away from it.  Most Chinese I know stopped using it already.
11:20 RandomDan: whatsapp is hard to monetize tho
11:20 blondetrader: also their advertizing is trash
11:20 radon224: TOS chat rooms are the only good form of communication
11:20 tmoney20g: open the secret trap door
11:20 stockhawk: 09:30 am here in the west should be the time
11:20 tmoney20g: why, what happens there that's significant ?
11:20 YClan: Hawk,   So, you figure... whateever SPX is at 10 mins from now... that it'll close lower than that end end of day?
11:22 stockhawk: Yclan> i am saying we will take out the low of the last hour at least for now. let us let the market talk to us.
11:23 radon224: The Market just told me to go get a sammich
11:23 chenmann: and a drink
11:23 radon224: and some cheetos
11:23 TnT: I just made a salad
11:23 RandomDan: I dunno hawk. The gravitational pull of ER will be strong by day end.
11:24 RandomDan: at least for fang
11:24 YClan: My trading action has been paused more than usuall lately.  I'm taking care of a 5 month old german shepperd pup (via rescue/shelter) and I have to care for it thru a front leg amputation.  So, he's kind of depressed, but recovering OK.
11:24 TheOnceAndFuture: Poor boy
11:24 TheOnceAndFuture: /girl
11:24 chenmann: wow nice radon
11:24 blondetrader: awwww
11:24 YClan: I have not had much time to follow/trade the market... distractions happening and trying to catch up on sleep, etc.
11:25 chenmann: we have 4 dogs, 2 rescue
11:25 RandomDan: I know the feeling YClan. Good luck to the both of you.
11:26 YClan: before the amputation, I took him to some dog parks.. and 1 lady is interested in adopting him, knowing that
11:26 YClan: knowing that he was soon to missing a leg.
11:26 stockhawk: RandomDan> i only go by patterns, levels annd behavior. The pattern is bearish but patterns alo fail and when they do, just go the other way for an explosive move.
11:27 RandomDan: I care about charts but also newsflow. I don't have magical charting powers like blonde.
11:27 RandomDan: and fundamentals matter to me as well
11:27 blondetrader: ha
11:28 stockhawk: if you wait for the news, you are already too late.
11:28 RandomDan: I don't trade any company I don't understand
11:28 YClan: Random,  none of us have those magical superpowers... BT controls those orbs and gives us just the peanut shells.
11:28 RandomDan: upcoming news hawk
11:29 stockhawk: price action precede the news, the news is late.
11:29 radon224: My Ouji board works ok
11:29 RandomDan: yep YClan, it's her market, we just trade in it
11:29 stockhawk: you must anticipate :)
11:29 TnT: I can often predict the past if I remember it correctly
11:29 Pete: Guys! What is your forecast on gold?
11:30 YClan: hawk,    x:30 now....      time to see if your pattern is sync'ed today.
11:30 tmoney20g: gold is shiny
11:30 RandomDan: hawk, for techs I do, believe me
11:30 stockhawk: yclan> sure
11:30 blondetrader: 6950 lis nq
11:30 TheOnceAndFuture: Gold is not a buy
11:30 Pete: lol
11:30 YClan: Pete,  screw gold....   you need to buy BitCon !
11:30 TheOnceAndFuture: as the dollar continues to deflate
11:30 Pete: Why not?
11:30 TnT: gold is a wasting asset, must pay for safe storage and pays no dividend
11:30 TheOnceAndFuture: Because fed rates
11:31 YClan: :30 News Bot: SocGen sees gold prices at USD 1,250 in Q4 2018, USD 1,275 Q1 2019, USD 1,275 for the whole 2019 
11:31 Pete: Mining stocks*?
11:32 TheOnceAndFuture: I don't see a shortage in gold supply
11:32 TheOnceAndFuture: Silver on the other hand?
11:32 YClan: Pete, you wanna but BitCon mining stocks !!
11:32 TheOnceAndFuture: No new mines opening
11:32 Pete: No, gold mining stocks!
11:32 RandomDan: neither
11:33 YClan: Pete,  BitCon is gunna be worth $200,000/coin really soon !!!
11:33 Pete: Why makes you think that?
11:34 YClan: Pete, because.... someone told me so !
11:34 Pete: lol
11:34 Pete: If some one tell you jump over the clif, you would do that?
11:35 YClan: Pete,   been there, done that!
11:35 Pete: Inzane!
11:36 YClan: Pete,    I even drank a glass of water because someone said it would be good for me.
11:37 Pete: lol! You are funny.
11:37 blondetrader: ok rty long 96.5 see what this is made of
11:37 Pete: What about the microsoft?
11:38 RandomDan: what about it?
11:39 TnT: very small and soft, microsoft
11:39 YClan: MSFT is in a temp downtrend... will probably test 200-day as a low (100.00/share) in the upcoming week or so.  But that coudl become a good buying opp.
11:40 YClan: longer trend.. I am curoius about 5g/cellular, like Nokia, Ericcson, qcom, etc.
11:40 radon224: careful TnT, this could get outta hand quickly
11:42 Swiss: How come all my attempted buys are rejected? Any thoughts?
11:42 TnT: live support in tab above or call trade desk, we don't know why and can't fix it
11:42 RandomDan: reason given?
11:43 admin_tculs: Swiss call the trade desk  800-672-2098 
11:43 radon224: I'm starting to see going to the gym early as being a viable strategy here.
11:43 tmoney20g: why waste your time
11:44 TnT: radon, easier to get somebody to scare you half to death, cardio done
11:45 RandomDan: and if they scare you full to death, cardio done too
11:45 TnT: lol
11:46 vipin123: index paused , waiting for next move.
11:46 YClan: MSFT... I see on Benziga that an analyst at Citigroup raised MSFT price target from $113/share to $114/share.  Wow, what a risky upgrade !!
11:47 tmoney20g: huge jump there
11:47 YClan: That kind of analyst probably drinks city tap water just as a stunt.
11:48 chenmann: megyan kelly out
11:48 chenmann: megyn
11:48 RandomDan: not surprised, given her ratings
11:48 TnT: for good?
11:48 streetglide: should have never left fox
11:49 YClan: :15 News Bot: Fed Vice Chair Clarida (permanent voter) says some further rate hikes are warranted 
11:49 streetglide: got too big for her britches
11:49 RandomDan: big offer plus she wanted to prove she wasn't a one trick pony
11:50 stockhawk: Yclan> what s wrong with drinking city tap water ?
11:50 RandomDan: nothing hawk, that's the point
11:51 YClan: hawk,  I do it all the time... often not even using the filtered/fridge.   Life on the edge... you know, a little lead never hurt me.
11:51 stockhawk: he he
11:51 TnT: bottled water no different, just a retired couple sitting in a tub in Pennsylvania filling the bottles
11:51 streetglide: lol
11:51 RandomDan: new word of the day: "macroprudential"
11:52 stockhawk: bottled water is not any healthier.
11:52 streetglide: I just threw up my Ozarka
11:52 YClan: TCULS,   what's on your lunch plans today?   sandwich or something microwaved, or what ?
11:52 radon224: lol
11:53 RandomDan: hawk that depends where.
11:53 TnT: Palladium giving up most of the gains from earlier in the week
11:54 stockhawk: random> you could bottle in PA and sell it in CA lol
11:54 RandomDan: Clarida not helping.
11:54 radon224: I have my tap water imported from Flint, Mich, just to be safe
11:55 TnT: what the heck is a permanent voter?  Is that like the dead peeps in Chicago?
11:55 stockhawk: i see. I am in Vancouver, our water is great.
11:55 YClan: I always wondered about that FIJI bottled water.. I mean... shipping water across the ocean gotta be pricey.. especially since all the acid rain clouds from China blowing towards Fiji cannot be good for the water there.
11:56 YClan: hawk,   Vanc/BC or Vanc/WA ?
11:56 stockhawk: BC
11:57 YClan: Hawk,  well... let's sing your new national anthem...   "ohhhh Cannnaaabiss !"
11:57 stockhawk: LOL
11:57 stockhawk: that is all we need now hey?
11:57 Panda: Hi all. Anyone notice lower than normal options trading?
11:58 stockhawk: i am going nowhere near that stuff. Hate the smell of it.
11:58 21sa: What should we look for on the spy resistance
11:58 21sa: Spx resistance
11:58 TnT: last time I went to Vancouver was 1969, parks were filled with pot smoking draft dodgers then, so guessing nothing changed now
11:59 YClan: Hawk, then how do you get in/out of the Tim Horton's store... gotta be the smell lingering around those stores from the customers.
11:59 tmoney20g: he's still in the store
11:59 TnT: beatiful area though
11:59 stockhawk: Yclan> just no more draft dodgers lol. but no, those days are gone.
12:00 YClan: Panda,   might help if you mention options for which tickers....
12:00 TnT: /ES 1.6 m
12:01 stockhawk: SPX  seems to struggle taking the last hourly high.
12:01 YClan: hawk,  no more draft dodgers..  just minimum wage dodgers who wanna hang out and not work.
12:02 stockhawk: Yclan> that is no longer possible, it is one of the most expensive city in the world.
12:04 stockhawk: are we finally gonna get the hourly reversal i was looking for?
12:06 blondetrader: welp stopped rty
12:06 TnT: yep, meandering indices
12:07 Gh0st: does anyone see ZIXI filling that gap? potential 20% gain on short play
12:07 TnT: also hanging around at the developing POC, I stay away from those, too many stops
12:11 vipin123: pullback time.
12:12 fred__w: downside break alert
12:13 YClan: Hawk,   what do church minister Bill Graham and the Toronto Maple Leafs have in common ?
12:14 YClan: Hawk,   they are both able to get 15,000 people to stand up and say "Jesus Christ!" together.
12:14 stockhawk: last hourly SPX bar was inside, we need to take it down for confirmation, even better if we take down the large expansion bar before that.
12:15 stockhawk: lol yclan.. i am a vancouver canuck :)
12:15 blondetrader: oh no another canadian
12:15 blondetrader: where is AL
12:16 stockhawk: blonde, lol
12:16 blondetrader: lol
12:17 tmoney20g: TRAP DOOR
12:17 radon224: You kept that /rty trade on a tight leash bt
12:17 streetglide: he's not going to be happy with his GE when he gets back
12:17 blondetrader: bc I dont trust rty
12:18 YClan: If SPX breaks down to hit 2690... that will be the test of the day, me believes..
12:18 streetglide: were you long or short?
12:18 blondetrader: was long
12:18 blondetrader: and I wanna be short lol
12:18 streetglide: lol
12:18 blondetrader: so thought I would take it long into a LH or maybe even a NH
12:18 blondetrader: then reverse....
12:18 blondetrader: no dice
12:18 YClan: street,  with his MegaBill winnings... he can buy all of GE on the cheap if he wants.
12:18 radon224: I'm about down to Plan Z at this point
12:19 Ashbash: Aurora
12:19 YClan: radon,  you seed a Z(prime) backup plan?
12:19 YClan: seed - need
12:19 Gh0st: does anyone see ZIXI filling that gap?
12:20 TnT: Plan F works well
12:20 radon224: no Yclan, because Plan Z is:  Quit for the day
12:20 vipin123: I think partial retracement of today's rally and then move up, will confirm yesterdays bottom.
12:20 tmoney20g: quit while you're behind
12:20 streetglide: expected a little more action today
12:20 radon224: haven't even made a trade
12:20 TnT: quiet inside day, than BAM, Fry Day
12:21 YClan: ZIXI,   what 'gap' are you talking about ?
12:21 streetglide: everyone scared to buy
12:21 streetglide: trap door syndrome
12:22 streetglide: it kind of like ptsd
12:22 blondetrader: lol
12:22 YClan: PTSD, or OMFG ?
12:23 radon224: Nervous as a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs
12:24 Gh0st: Yclan gap from Tuesday 5.08 to about 5.60
12:25 vipin123: if market moves up further today, I think search for bottom will continue
12:26 YClan: Ghost,  I don't understand... are you asking if it will drop back down to 'fill the gap'???
12:27 Gh0st: yes
12:28 amalia: No
12:28 YClan: Ghost,  on ZIXI, the weekly and daily stochastic are both upward/long.  So, any pullback should hold at about 5.50+

12:31 stockhawk: normally 2 SPX inside bars should be bullish ( last 2 hours)  going below 2676 may translate into re-visiting yesterday's low  and possibly 2620. Right now 2728 is the overhead and 2676 the floor. The market will let us now so we just have to wait and watch. Meanwhile i am staying short unless 2728 is taken out  with conviction.
12:32 stockhawk: out of here for a while :)

14:18 blondetrader: I just wanna ride to support to see whats under hood
14:18 fred__w: bt  you dont strike me as a bottom fisher
14:18 TnT: internals really strong
14:18 blondetrader: only when it is against the HTF
14:18 blondetrader: yes they r grrrr
14:18 fred__w: whats htf?
14:18 streetglide: a lot of my chit aint doing much.....is this a house of cards?
14:19 TnT: higher time frame
14:19 fred__w: or do you mean hft?
14:19 fred__w: ahh  ok
14:19 blondetrader: higher tf
14:19 tmoney20g: harbor freight ?
14:19 TnT: lot's of TLA stuff in here (Three Letter Acryonym)
14:19 blondetrader: lol
14:20 fred__w: hmmm  it seems wiser to at least peek over the established downchannel
14:20 radon224: The ones with 4 letters get the admins attention
14:20 Anonymous so far: is Unfi a good buy
14:21 fred__w: unless you mean the 15min tf
14:22 radon224: On a very high time frame, we are all dead anyhow.
14:22 tmoney20g: like, relative to space time ?
14:23 Alexfv: What’s going on with GE, will it hit $10/share
14:23 tmoney20g: sure will
14:23 stockhawk: 2728 is the overhead level i mentioned before. Bulls need to take it out very strongly . Tomorrow is the important weekly close that reveals the underlying agenda. Let's let the market show its hand. Holding on to my short 4 now.
14:24 TnT: House of Fabrics has a sale going on Space Time, 99 cents a cubic yard week
14:24 tmoney20g: excellent deal
14:25 radon224: I never knew Space Time was measured by volume
14:25 radon224: I thought it would have been sq. ft.
14:25 tmoney20g: def has to be metric
14:25 TnT: space = 3 dimensions = volume
14:25 VolCrush: wat in der wild wild world of sports is goin on around here, we back in  a bull market
14:25 tmoney20g: turtle market
14:26 tmoney20g: vol you playin any upside ?
14:26 TnT: would be hard to go into space if it was only 2 dimensions
14:26 TnT: would need to get really reeally flat
14:26 VolCrush: nope
14:27 radon224: I thought the addition of Time would flatten out the space
14:27 TnT: nope
14:27 blondetrader: timing W
14:28 TnT: time is 4 th dimension,  There are either 9 or eleven dimensions depending on who you talk to
14:28 radon224: actually using Google, Space Time has 4 dimensions
14:28 stockhawk: volcrush> you cannot say that yet, we are just testing the overhead level, so no proff of bull market yet:)
14:28 radon224: so it should be sold in Quadratic Yards
14:28 blondetrader: now to go test support and see if tomorrow we cant get the job done for next week
14:28 TnT: what I said radon
14:29 TnT: you misunderstand the  meaning of dimension, cubic yard week is very straight forward
14:29 bobospy: AMZN up 122 points 
14:29 tmoney20g: you don't say
14:30 stockhawk: what i find suspect is that market is up over 483 points without ovehead resisatance being strongly breached.
14:30 blondetrader: well we r up a lot
14:30 TnT: big move, but still inside day up
14:30 blondetrader: need to digest pullback to new support then see imo
14:31 lilFish: time is a human construct
14:31 blondetrader: time waits for no one
14:32 TheSpot4Me: Can’t believe chocolate is down.. Who’s being healthy again..
14:32 lilFish: :)
14:32 radon224: Like sands through the hourglass of time, those are the days of our lives
14:33 lilFish: watching red and green bars on our screens
14:33 TnT: how we measure time is made up, just like physical dimensions are made up, but they all exist even if we did not
14:33 fred__w: the volume profiles are still not compelling  at least yet
14:33 blondetrader: agree
14:33 streetglide: so this is all fake, tnt?
14:34 lilFish: i think that which we are is beyond space and time, but that is for another chat room
14:34 fred__w: ..they should build and reinforce tf upon next higher tf  and so on
14:34 blondetrader: lets go support
14:34 lilFish: time for some peeps to take profs
14:34 blondetrader: ok so es ideal to hold:  85-79
14:34 TnT: yeah, volume profile looks interesting here
14:34 streetglide: m pattern tops
14:35 blondetrader: rty 87 or 83
14:35 TnT: the top on NQ is right at yesterdays POC
14:35 blondetrader: 6890 nq
14:35 lilFish: hope amzn blows it out
14:36 blondetrader: hope they chit the bed
14:36 blondetrader: I am mad
14:36 lilFish: and googl
14:36 lilFish: mad as hell
14:36 blondetrader: I still have part of that bear play on :((
14:36 lilFish: and aint gonna take it no mo
14:36 TnT: calm down bt, I am your emotional support squirrel
14:36 bitcode: Hello peeps, random question, can retailers have access to Level 3 quotes? or is it olny for NASD members? 
14:36 blondetrader: lol
14:36 radon224: I'll never forget a couple of years ago when AMZN accidentally released their earnings mid-day.  It was crazy
14:36 blondetrader: well if they do poorly maybe that lets us go test support
14:36 lilFish: I still have -1875 short strikes amzn  pcs
14:37 streetglide: Russell wont give up
14:37 blondetrader: I need to go get my steel toed boots on

14:40 lilFish: I'm not selling anything under this mkt at the moment
14:40 tmoney20g: i have nothing, too chicken right now
14:41 stockhawk: i am convinced today was an unsuccessful test of the 2728 level. Could be a sucker rally? Tomorrow will tell :)
14:41 VolCrush: welp i have 150 points OTM, atm
14:42 streetglide: is the House of Cards sponsoring this rally?

16:07 TnT: brain damage channels

16:07 Rebecca: Blonde had I listened to u and bought a collar u wud have saved me 200k ....thanks for trying. Now I need to decide how to get out of this amazon position
16:07 chenmann: so u didnt sell today?
16:07 chenmann: not any?
16:07 Rebecca: No
16:07 Kobias: I like  to have them on the background... Saved me a time or two [CNBC
16:08 chenmann: sorry rebecca
16:08 efu: kob ok
16:08 amalia: EasyE's plan was the best Rebecca.
16:08 Rebecca: Now I’m long on margin
16:08 bigworm: so just a short cover
16:08 chenmann: not good
16:08 efu: rebecca i was wishing for you
16:08 Kobias: Tell you this - all talking heads talk out of their portfolio. Always.
16:08 chenmann: amzn testing 1600
16:09 Rebecca: Thank u...I was up over 100k I got greedy...always learn the hardest way
16:09 efu: kobias why else would they be there?
16:09 RandomDan: you can get bloomberg anywhere you have Internet. Get an Apple TV, done.
16:09 RandomDan: or... just on the computer
16:09 efu: rebecca needs a man to divert her from gambling lol
16:10 RandomDan: but I would rather have it on a TV
16:10 Rebecca: damn straight
16:10 Rebecca: When do u guys think it might go up
16:10 efu: <<< not young
16:10 Kobias: Dan - I meant without paying extra... I hear Bloomberg is the better one - is that true?
16:10 TnT: << older than you most likely
16:10 Rebecca: I’m 43 hopefully I have time to recover from this devastating blow
16:11 RandomDan: I don't pay anything
16:11 efu: according to SPY the es will open under 60
16:11 efu: 70 i meas
16:11 RandomDan: At least on a gen 3 apple TV it runs all day no problem
16:12 Kobias: Rebecca - what is your position?
16:12 RandomDan: I don't watch it all day tho. dome days not at all.
16:12 RandomDan: some
16:12 Kobias: Dan - I need to fo some reaearch.. Sure there's a solution
16:12 Rebecca: 1500 long shares naked bought at 1771
16:13 RandomDan: used Apple TV gen 3
16:13 RandomDan: I will probably subscribe tho, for other content.
16:14 RandomDan: it's not expensive. Only Bloomberg Terminal is expensive.
16:15 Kobias: Rebecca - stocks?  it's AMZN one day it'll rule the world together with GOOG - just hold. Maybe wait for a hickup to reduce
16:15 Rebecca: Yeah but I’m paying 400$ in interest
16:15 Kobias: Yeh thought about subscribing.
16:15 featherweight: Wooof
16:16 chenmann: looking at DOOM tomorrow
16:16 RandomDan: $400 per what?
16:17 Rebecca: Per day
16:17 Kobias: You've gotta set with yourself the max amount you're willing to obsorb [loss] and sell for that amouynt. This is too expensive.
16:17 Kobias: Why use margin?????
16:17 Rebecca: Because I’m an idiot w gambling issue
16:18 Rebecca: I don’t have the $ to cover this without selling stocks
16:18 amalia: Just give me your money...
16:18 Kobias: Me too. lol. That's why I leave my cards home when going to the Cassino
16:19 Kobias: Casino*
16:19 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: ouchie mama
16:20 Rebecca: It keeps falling wish I sold at 1720 after fall
16:20 Kobias: Rebecca go pay someone to consult you. It can't cost much and may save you some of the loss
16:20 Rebecca: Yeah I have someone in mind shud have called yesterday
16:21 Rebecca: Thanks all. I. Need a stiff drink think I’m in shock
16:21 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: what happened rebecca?
16:21 Rebecca: I’m down 210k on amazon and counting
16:22 bigworm: did you do options
16:22 Rebecca: Yes but I sold them yesterday
16:22 TnT: peeps should not bet on earnings in general, it is just pure gambling
16:22 Rebecca: They expired today
16:22 chenmann: oboy
16:22 bigworm: is that all of your account?
16:22 Kobias: Rebecca - Then, don't make any decissions in this state. Wait. See a movie. Play PUBG... Let this relax first. :)
16:22 Rebecca: Was amazon report that bad for this fall
16:22 amalia: It was a pure gamble
16:23 Rebecca: Yup
16:23 bigworm: how much on margin
16:23 amalia: I just wish you knew beforehand it was a gamble.
16:23 TnT: until you accept that it was gambling, you cannot be saved
16:23 Rebecca: 3 million
16:23 bigworm: so you dont own the options now or you sold them yesterday
16:23 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: so sorry rebecca
16:23 TnT: cheez

16:24 chenmann: is it just me or r we being played....?
16:24 amalia: explain
16:24 amalia: ^
16:24 amalia: chen
16:24 Eedie: We’re being played
16:24 Rebecca: Wish I followed my gut and bought puts expiring next week but they were so expensive
16:24 TnT: yep
16:24 TnT: berg
16:24 bigworm: so you made 46k then it went down 240
16:24 amalia: 3mill margin but the puts were expensive. lol
16:25 Rebecca: No u aren’t. It’s very real and upsetting y wud I lie
16:25 Eedie: It’s probably Alpha in disguise
16:25 radon224: lol
16:25 amalia: lol Ee

16:26 Tanya: Babies
16:26 Rebecca: Yes
16:26 bigworm: your whole account is gone?
16:27 Rebecca: No
16:27 Eedie: Why would you put so much capital in one place?
16:27 amalia: Like Mobius sometimes says, better to give all that money to charity. You'll at least feel good about losing it, Rebecca. 
16:27 Rebecca: I lost 500k in two weeks I have 1 mil left after I pay margin
16:27 Rebecca: It was my life savings for a house
16:27 amalia: apathy
16:28 TnT: sounds like you have intelligence issues
16:28 Rebecca: Hopefully there’s a miracle
16:28 amalia: disconnect
16:28 chenmann: ouch tnt
16:28 amalia: TnT +1
16:28 amalia: It's true.
16:28 Eedie: Why wouldn’t you just dabble in the markets first before you went all in
16:28 amalia: Just like clipping the brakes on a new care off the lot then heading straight for the freeway.
16:29 Kobias: hhh
16:29 bigworm: so what options did you sell?
16:29 bigworm: can you recover or did you sell naked or whats the story?
16:29 amalia: Scroll up big
16:29 AlphaInvestor: I am warming to INTC*^
16:29 Rebecca: I made 500k day trading I knew the risk my bad addiction is serious thing went wrong getting portfolio margin account
16:29 Eedie: I’m just trying to figure out why she took such a large position? If this is true at all

16:30 AlphaInvestor: I went from cold to frigid on WDC*
16:30 Rebecca: I had 1790 puts...originally bought 20 contracts
16:30 Eedie: What did you do to earn that money before trading?
16:30 amalia: Worked 43 years for it.
16:30 Eedie: Ok I guess she’s not alpha
16:30 Eedie: Hey alpha
16:30 Rebecca: Ok thanks all good night
16:30 Eedie: Did you inherit it?
16:31 TnT: are you in Canada AI? might explain the cold
16:31 Tommydog: To win big you have to invest big
16:31 Eedie: All I know is that I would be on the horn with the trade desk instead of talking to people in here
16:31 ameriman: she is one of the anonymous traders
16:31 Eedie: No offense guys
16:31 Eedie: It’s all bs
16:31 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: wait till apple drops on earnings.  gonna be a blood bath.
16:31 bigworm: im confused. you said you lost 500k and made 500 k
16:32 ameriman: Darryl that might trigger bear market
16:32 chenmann: ameri, remember someone asked why would u think amzn er would be bad?
16:32 chenmann: yesterday
16:32 chenmann: well
16:32 Tommydog: We will return to big profits it’s a journey

16:33 amalia: He's not kidding
16:33 bigworm: 80 percent kidding
16:33 TnT: peeps can be crazy
16:33 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: i surely hope ''rebecca'' didn't lose all that cash for real
16:33 amalia: there we go
16:33 DaveW5348: If she bought AMZN 1790 puts, she's going to do great right?  AMZN tanked
16:33 ameriman: Chen /NQ sold 150 points on that
16:33 AlphaInvestor: I am in Canada
16:33 Tanya: A lesson for all newbies
16:33 bigworm: she said she sold
16:33 bigworm: not bought
16:33 AlphaInvestor: WDC beat but warned
16:33 TnT: lol AI, temp?
16:33 amalia: It's not uncommon for that amount of money to be lost for those with 3mill+ AUM
16:34 AlphaInvestor: Then Cy announced jv to make NAND
16:34 AlphaInvestor: 40s today
16:34 Tommydog: Amd will rise again
16:34 ameriman: like the Phoenix?
16:34 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: if she's got 3 million and lost 210K, how is that a problem?
16:34 ameriman: from ashes
16:34 DaveW5348: at 17:30 she said bought 20 contracts, so she meant to say sold them?
16:34 bigworm: amd is going down just like bitcoin
16:34 radon224: That conversation was troll-a-riffic.  Made my day.
16:34 TnT: how exactly do peeps end up with that kind of money and that stupid amalia?
16:34 Tommydog: Hoping for Monday
16:34 bigworm: i dont think she has 3 mil
16:35 DaveW5348: sorry to hear it either way
16:35 bigworm: lets play a game.  guess how many pennies are in that jar...
16:35 Eedie: I swear I think Rebecca is my cousin.... I have a cousin who inherited 4 million dollars. The whole family swears that she’d blow through that in 2 years
16:35 AlphaInvestor: I have 3 million - Turkish lira
16:35 Eedie: Well there you go
16:35 TnT: lol eeddie
16:35 Eedie: True dat Tnt
16:35 amalia: Don't have to be smart to have lots of money.
16:35 TnT: 17:31 News Bot: Test headline - Please ignore
16:36 amalia: TnT's favorite news headlines
16:36 Eedie: I need to ask her if she’s from Louisiana
16:36 radon224: OMG....that's the sign of the Apocolypse
16:36 Tommydog: I don’t have any million
16:36 radon224: First a Test Headline, then it starts raining locusts.
16:36 Tommydog: Yet
16:36 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I never play earnings unless in a bear market.  of course we could be in one now, but it's kinda early.
16:37 TnT: ^^ true
16:37 Kobias: Well, I feel sorry for her either way... Lying or not.
16:37 chenmann: ^^
16:39 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: how short was amzn on earnings?  i feel lazy to look it up.
16:39 TnT: revenue was the issue
16:39 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: what i meant, sorry
16:39 RandomDan: I don't know what to make of it. I remember last time she was here that I said don't trade on margin. If she really had $3 million, no need anyway
16:40 Kobias: true
16:40 TnT: likely a ruse, not worth our attention
16:40 chenmann: amzn also guided down
16:40 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: dang, i was thinking bout shorting snap
16:40 bigworm: so whats the take on the market
16:40 bigworm: after hours es dropping it like its hot
16:41 chenmann: DOOM
16:41 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: it's ikely to go down tomorrow ;)
16:41 chenmann: it will
16:41 TnT: correction continues, DOOM no longer on back order
16:41 ameriman: /NQ made inverted hammer on daily
16:41 bigworm: should i draw a little trendline thingy
16:42 TnT: watch your fingers, this is 2 way market, we still can get a bounce  on Friday
16:42 TnT: it is chaos
16:42 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: like i said, wait till apple misses.   
16:42 Kobias: TnT - agreed. No way to know
16:43 chenmann: nuts, down 600 up 400 now tomorrow down who knows how much
16:43 TnT: look at daily chart, know thy risk
16:43 bigworm: what about the 200 day
16:44 radon224: Have a good evening everyone
16:44 amalia: MinRange loves this volatility
16:44 chenmann: later radon
16:44 bigworm: its time spend under that is like the time i spend watching backstreet boys videos on youtube
16:44 amalia: Laters, Radon.
16:44 bigworm: way too much time
16:44 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: you know how many people are putting cash in apple, thinking it's "bucking the trend"?
16:44 TnT: u2, all enjoy evening
16:44 Tanya: October is the worst month, just hang in there until It passes
16:45 Kobias: Am getting the "shake before use" treatment from ADBE for 2 and half weeks. I think to concede defeat and coming here to whine about it...
16:45 Kobias: Tanya - histroically you're correct
16:45 amalia: Tanya, some people think the diminishing volatility that comes in Nov/Dec is gonna change so hold on to your helmets and stay strapped in.
16:48 Tanya: Amalia, from my observations in the past with all my trades, those I got out licked my wounds and ignored them. They all went up big time!
16:48 RandomDan: I have no visibility for tomorrow. I think we are oversold, but we could oversell even more.
16:48 TnT: may I say, on the other hand, rising rates are not  a good thing for the market, never have been.  I have been preaching that for over a year
16:48 Lawnpro: Anyone think Amzn will pop tomorrow
16:49 TnT: housing is faulltering as a result
16:49 TnT: likewise with car sales
16:49 Tanya: Dan, tomorrow could be a down day, who knows. Let’s the market bleeds until....
16:49 TnT: don't fight the fed, don't fight the interest rate trend
16:50 Tanya: For the year, who are up and who are down?
16:50 Tanya: Not just the past three weeks
16:51 Tanya: Raise your hand
16:51 TnT: I am break even, so what is the point, all about what your individual strategy is
16:51 Eedie: I’m up for the year but had a brutal past two weeks
16:52 Tanya: Me too Eedie, up for the but drowning in the last three weeks, not realized losses
16:52 TnT: the chat room is about sharing information, not about who did what
16:52 Eedie: Past 2-3 weeks took about 1/3 of what I made and then I recouped some of the loss yesterday and today
16:53 bigworm: anyone in CVNA
16:53 Eedie: I’m just playing futures until mid term election is over
16:54 Tanya: Worked so hard for 10 months and all gone in two weeks
16:54 bigworm: you?
16:54 Tanya: Market brutal indeed
16:55 James: dems sank this bull market on purpose so repubs would do crappy in midterms.
16:55 Tanya: We still have two more months to trade until year end
16:55 TnT: not really James
16:55 TnT: the market just hates uncertainty
16:56 bigworm: Market cant go up forever
16:56 TnT: that too
16:56 RandomDan: I am not saying fight the Fed
16:56 bigworm: infact i would be scared if it did
16:56 Kobias: Dan - agreed . Oversold bigtime [on ADBE too]... But  no way to tell. "Logic" sez it'll continue up and down  all the way to midterm... By then I think inertia can take us lower still. But My gut tells me the rally is not over yet... Just an opinion
16:56 bigworm: its not just the rate hikes in itself. they also are unloading fed balance sheet
16:56 RandomDan: I just think amzn, goog, oversold
16:56 bigworm: why oversold?
16:56 TnT: absolutely bigworm
16:56 bigworm: maybe overbought
16:57 RandomDan: true big, true
16:57 James: Had a decent day going until after the close all hell broke loose.
16:57 bigworm: so i read the defecit issue the other day.  I had to go actually look at the numbers to make sense of it.
16:57 TnT: anyone who is paying attention would realize that rising rates and selling QE assets is a not great for equities
16:57 RandomDan: look at their numbers. Even the GOOG revenue "miss" is a huge increase YoY
16:58 Tanya: Traders faced margin calls yesterday, thus they sold anything of value yesterday, so irrational
16:58 RandomDan: not to mention the earnings
16:58 bigworm: there was actual revenue generated but spending is just off the chain.  Biggest increase in spending?  servicing national debt. what happens when rates go up with that debt?
16:58 efu: people sick of net
16:58 bigworm: no its not TNT
16:58 Tanya: Any good earnings met with short coverings
16:59 bigworm: but theoretically, wouldnt issueance of more debt by fed gov kind of offset that
16:59 ameriman: efu fishnet?
16:59 TnT: I get 1.9% on an online savings account, was not that way before, competing returns
16:59 Tanya: Not truly buying long
16:59 RandomDan: efu people use the net to complain about the net. It's not going anywhere.
17:00 RandomDan: TnT, 1.9%? really? in this room that's zero
17:00 efu: didnt say its going anywhere. i said tired
17:00 bigworm: so if fed unloads balance sheets that shrinks money supply and raises rates, also raising short term rates.  
17:01 TnT: Dan, point is ordinary peeps that know nothing get that return and zero risk
17:01 TnT: rather than invest in the market with risk
17:01 TnT: not talking about me
17:01 RandomDan: I think it affects institutional buyers more than anything.
17:02 bigworm: what does random
17:02 TnT: and individuals
17:02 RandomDan: rates
17:02 bigworm: lol what?
17:02 TnT: you are not considering the spectrum of where money goes and why
17:03 bigworm: also think about the federal gov
17:03 TnT: equities are one piece of the pie
17:03 bigworm: they are issuing more debt now to pay for the defecit which would shrink money supply as well
17:04 TnT: same cycles repeat over time, this is one of them, called rising rates
17:04 RandomDan: big, that depends who buys it.
17:04 bigworm: so the fed and gov both doing stuff to accelerate rate increases probablly too fast
17:04 RandomDan: foreign buyers don't have that effect
17:05 bigworm: how much of our debt is sold or owned by foreigners
17:05 bigworm: they still convert to our dollar
17:05 RandomDan: someone explain to me why we pay like Italy
17:05 bigworm: and increase the dollar
17:05 RandomDan: Germany pays 1%
17:05 bigworm: for what
17:05 RandomDan: debt
17:06 bigworm: we pay on our debt however much we have to service that debt
17:06 RandomDan: our 10 year nearly the dame rate as italy's
17:06 bigworm: issuing more debt means more payment on that debt
17:06 RandomDan: same
17:06 bigworm: right but that is the secondary market rate
17:07 bigworm: thats not the primary market where they issued it.  
17:07 bigworm: increaseing rates actually decrease the value of those bonds issued
17:07 RandomDan: I get all that. But Italy?
17:08 RandomDan: That's our benchmark?
17:08 bigworm: which means that they sell those bonds ( because they dont want to hold lower rate bonds because historically low) and what does selling those bonds do?
17:08 TnT: all have a good evening, rudimentary economics discussion
17:08 bigworm: lol yeah
17:09 RandomDan: Italy has 131.8% debt to GDP ratio
17:09 bigworm: and we have 105%
17:09 bigworm: but we are not italy
17:09 RandomDan: we pay the same rate they do
17:10 bigworm: ?
17:10 RandomDan: but we have less debt
17:10 TnT: cheez, youse peeps are hilarious
17:10 RandomDan: compare the 10 years
17:10 TnT: latre
17:10 TnT: later
17:10 bigworm: well whats yoru take TNT
17:10 bigworm: am i saying incorrect things?
17:11 RandomDan: no you are fine big, all true
17:12 RandomDan: I just don't understand relative yields of sovereign bonds
17:12 bigworm: you mean why they are different
17:15 bigworm: I see you typing TNT
17:15 bigworm: lol
17:16 bigworm: are you about to educte me?
17:16 TnT: ok, I will weigh in, rates that a country charges are influenced by stablility and safety for the issue at hand.along with stability of the underlying currency.  Italy cannot compare to the US in terms of being assured of getting money back.  Same with Mexico, high yields are due to uncertainty in getting money back
17:16 bigworm: educate
17:16 Kobias: GN TnT
17:16 bigworm: agree
17:16 Kobias: oh, you're still here... sry
17:16 TnT: so huge number of factors, not just rate
17:17 bigworm: :)
17:18 TnT: rate could be much lower here than it is, and would be accepted, it is higher only due to fed actions to prevent excess inflation
17:19 bigworm: where did you go to school again TN
17:19 bigworm: TNT
17:19 bigworm: I thought you said it was a really good school
17:19 TnT: we are rising back toward normal at roughly 1% per year, but are not back to normal rates yet
17:19 bigworm: what would yo uconsider normal?
17:20 bigworm: i really dont know what that is
17:20 bigworm: maybe 6 % on the 10
17:20 Kobias: 6% ? - plz explain
17:20 TnT: I did not bigworm, I avoided the draft by joining the Navy Nuclear program and was in the commercial nuclear industry after that. I am an engineer
17:21 bigworm: ahh ok thats what I remember now. SUBSSS!!!!
17:21 bigworm: idk 6 percent
17:21 bigworm: just a guess
17:21 bigworm: not saying its going there but it does have to normalize
17:21 TnT: going to a big reunion next week, get to see a Trident sub
17:21 bigworm: that sounds fun...
17:22 TnT: I will look it up but up a bit from hered
17:22 TnT: here
17:22 Kobias: What's the inflation rate now?
17:23 bigworm: im really not sure, last time i looked it wasnt that high
17:23 bigworm: like around 2 percent
17:23 RandomDan: why we pay triple what hermany does and almost the same as Italy
17:23 RandomDan: the US has never defaulted
17:23 TnT: what made stocks rise to huge bubble is low rates, now the competion for return on assets shifts toward other assets
17:23 Kobias: 2% is considered good and healthy in a growing economy
17:23 bigworm: exactly
17:24 RandomDan: Italy and Germany have
17:24 bigworm: yeah but fed is typically late
17:24 bigworm: they want to be ahead of the curve
17:24 Kobias: Sounds mm foolish
17:25 bigworm: idk if it sounds foolish
17:25 bigworm: its not just about the rates
17:25 TnT: also, the fed deficit is still growing at an alarming  rate, this affects all assets and is something of importance to watch
17:25 bigworm: think about the tools that we have when there is a recession.  Federal reserve and the federal gov. monetary and fiscal policy
17:25 bigworm: yeah i been watching
17:26 TnT: not sure why Trump is not getting concerned about that, I am
17:26 bigworm: its scary
17:26 Kobias: it's  about over heated economy, I get that.b But itis not ordinary times... Trade war and all...
17:26 bigworm: well...
17:26 bigworm: did you read last report TNT
17:26 bigworm: look at bush trade war
17:26 bigworm: how it impacted the economy
17:26 bigworm: it really didnt alot with his tariffs
17:27 TnT: that is not it bigworm, it is big spending with big tax cuts.
17:27 bigworm: no im not saying trade war
17:28 bigworm: i was just responding to someone else
17:28 TnT: so, agree to an extent, but revenues are not keeping  up
17:28 bigworm: im saying trade war isnt as big of an impact as headlines suggest
17:28 TnT: correct, absolutely
17:29 bigworm: biggest part of defecit that I read from CBO was social security, medicaid, medicare, defense, and most of all was debt service payments
17:29 TnT: my point was I am still very concerned with deficit spending
17:29 bigworm: we actually gained around 1 percent revenue
17:29 bigworm: ohh yes
17:29 bigworm: me too
17:29 bigworm: but alot of its baked in
17:29 bigworm: seriously how do we get out of debt service payments
17:30 TnT: look back at Clinton years, the economy grew to offset deficit spending and actually moved to a surplus, anything can happen
17:31 bigworm: yes but clinton broke the machine
17:31 TnT: well, there is that
17:31 TnT: lol
17:31 TnT: it happened by accident
17:31 bigworm: if you look at time series of home owneership and banks use of derivites after two piece of legistatlure he passed
17:31 bigworm: you see a statistical signifiance and an increase
17:32 Kobias: Clinton had the unique energizing of that new invention, the Internet. I think that is the key to the prospere in his time.
17:32 bigworm: at that point in time using quarterly data
17:32 bigworm: i argue with people all day long at vereran resource center on campus
17:32 bigworm: so i like to come prepared
17:32 TnT: yes Kobias, big jumps in productivity were not his fault
17:32 Kobias: hhh
17:33 amalia: hhh?
17:33 Kobias: But wait, wasn't it Al Gore who invented the internet?
17:33 amalia: That's the 2nd time I see that.
17:33 TnT: lol
17:33 Kobias: jk... appologies

17:45 Kobias: cool
17:46 blondetrader: TNT is old

17:47 TnT: all I had to play with when young was rocks, dirt was not invented yet
17:48 TnT: my cardiologist said wow, still beating
17:48 Kobias: The old West..?
17:49 TnT: fyi, I was on a Lafayette class Polaris sub
17:49 bigworm: lol
17:50 RandomDan: I can get on any airplane you want. I would be claustrophobic on a sub.
17:50 TnT: 33 ft in diameter, 425 ft long
17:51 TnT: so very spacey, big boat
17:52 Kobias: Visited one once - nothing like what you guys got. Nope. I would kill the crew and launch the ordenance... Too tight.
17:52 Kobias: It was an old diesel sub from the seventies
17:53 TnT: most diesel boats are very small by comparison
17:53 RandomDan: TnT, no windows, steel all around. No thanks
17:53 amalia: does bt just have TOS on all the time
17:53 Kobias: I know.
17:53 RandomDan: I di

17:54 RandomDan: I close it friday night, open it Sunday night
17:55 RandomDan: TnT yeah they probably have that down to a science
17:55 TnT: head shrinks are amazing
17:56 Kobias: LOL   Cramer is calling a change upwards again. He changed directions like 5 times the last     4 days
17:56 RandomDan: give me an airplane with an engine out, turbulence, losing altitude, I'd still feel better than in a sub
17:57 Kobias: Dan, are you a pilot?
17:57 amalia: That's like the person who said they'd rather be with MS13 than with trump voters. lol
17:57 RandomDan: Cramer was disoriented yesterday, thought selling was over by one PM or something
17:58 TnT: or, could be that peeps that volunteer for sub duty already understand themselves for the most part
17:58 RandomDan: Private
17:58 Kobias: ok. Cool.
17:58 TnT: I have a private ticket Dan
17:58 TnT: single engine land
17:58 Kobias: Yeh he's too hastey

18:03 amalia: jay, this room is not penny stock friendly. We mostly are facetious to those who ask for an opinion on penny stocks. I'm just yanking your chain. Try ShadowRoom if you want an opinion on penny stocks.
18:03 ameriman: HMNY
18:04 TnT: for penny stocks, try setting your money on fire  to heat your living spaces, you get a benefit for your investment
18:04 amalia: Donating it to charity or giving it to me is a better solution, imo.
18:04 chenmannmobile: markets too hard for me, i d be on sidelines , talking politics and watching those who play it....
18:04 jay: y do u think hmny is good ?
18:05 TnT: wow 19:03 News Bot: Magnitude 6.9 quakes strikes off Greece, according to USGS

18:19 chenmannmobile: lol
18:19 chenmannmobile: u guys
18:19 tmoney20g: actually, i just did the analyze tab
18:20 tmoney20g: because of what i bought the 1675 put at earlier today, even if amzn opened at 1650, i'd still have loss from theta
18:20 amalia: Unless you're his accountant, who knows how much.
18:20 tmoney20g: lol
18:20 VolCrush: AAPL pretty much no reaction to all of this, which would make it more difficult for /nq to slide
18:20 amalia: My mentor says, believe none of what you hear and half of what you see.
18:21 chenmannmobile: yes vol, der fruit s the last man standing after amzn today, all FANG git now
18:21 chenmannmobile: hit
18:21 VolCrush: dats pretty awesome for mr crash, does he tradee futters or options?
18:21 ameriman: futters
18:21 ameriman: /ES
18:21 TnT: It was Benjamin Franklin who always said not to  believe everything you see on the internet
18:21 chenmannmobile: ha
18:21 VolCrush: must be puttin on some size, gud on him/her
18:22 tmoney20g: didn't he and thomas jefferson invent the internet ?
18:22 ameriman: Yea 50 to 70 contracts per trade
18:22 ameriman: scalping
18:22 VolCrush: i believe it TnT, ive met some pretty awesome traders; those that have a plan and system can absolutely kill it
18:22 chenmannmobile: good market for scalpe, big range and chops
18:23 TnT: and Al Gore got a Nobel Prize for inventing what?
18:23 ameriman: For example today he shorted from 2722 72 contracts
18:23 chenmannmobile: crash used to be here but got banned ....lol
18:23 VolCrush: der internets
18:23 ameriman: Covered at 2713
18:23 tmoney20g: al gore is known for firearm safety i think
18:23 ameriman: Saw the trade called real time
18:23 TnT: no, global warming
18:23 VolCrush: really how long ago? i dont remember him
18:23 chenmannmobile: feb i think
18:24 ameriman: He called real time short at 2722
18:24 ameriman: And covered 2713
18:24 chenmannmobile: he was killing it during the feb crash
18:24 chenmannmobile: hence the handle crashman
18:25 VolCrush: ive been banned theyll let u back in, but honestly the 6 weeks out of chat were some of my best trading weeks, no idea if thats a true correlation
18:25 amalia: stories are nice.
18:26 chenmannmobile: lol, true vol, i dont know how u can trade and be on chat , i m only here when soh or done for the day
18:26 TnT: still unusual, two big quakes just offshore greece, 5.0 then 6.8

18:26 chenmannmobile: all got killed this month

18:27 amalia: OCOs help with trading and chattin
18:27 VolCrush: i was too focused on hunting season, i own it
18:27 chenmannmobile: same
18:27 chenmannmobile: vol
18:28 TnT: no charts, nice, like not wearing seat belts
18:28 ameriman: chen he uses chart
18:28 ameriman: Price action
18:28 chenmannmobile: oh maybe i m thinking of someone else
18:28 G3_: best not to be in chat when one has a big /es /nq trade on.  imho
18:28 ameriman: and price levels
18:28 chenmannmobile: what g3 said
18:28 VolCrush: awesome, too bad hes no longer around
18:29 amalia: The industry standard is if you can afford 4 contracts, trade 1. Means crashman can afford 280 contracts.
18:29 VolCrush: banked 3 large this week
18:30 tmoney20g: vol, your q's gonna work out ?
18:30 tmoney20g: what strike did you buy ?
18:30 VolCrush: yah
18:30 G3_: razor focus is required
18:30 VolCrush: 160
18:30 VolCrush: i mean it depends how much we get a bounce ON, but by the close they had almost doubled
18:31 VolCrush: and there will be some volatility in the a.m.
18:31 VolCrush: i tink bronx hit it as well

18:32 VolCrush: deal is nuttin really has had a run up into E, other than that cray cray chit today on AMZN
18:32 tmoney20g: if you bought 10 @ .14
18:33 chenmannmobile: yes vol, they killed premires for both call and puts
18:34 VolCrush: IM curious to see if they dump amzn like they did NFLX, not sure GOOGL has much of a chance, kinda the red headed step child

18:48 chenmannmobile: good er and guided higher, also said china trade war no impact
18:49 chenmannmobile: only thing is the intc chart may look like h&s
18:50 chenmannmobile: but think the right shoulder is not gonna play out
18:50 VolCrush: interesting, i noticed NVDA was bid a bit today prob in sympathy with chips reporting tonight, that could be an opp
18:50 chenmannmobile: yes, they were buying all chip stock , mu
18:50 chenmannmobile: maybe cause they hit the hardest
18:50 chenmannmobile: who knows
18:52 VolCrush: yup, wont mean chit if /nq continues down
18:53 chenmannmobile: alot of talk about testing es 2500ish out there....
18:53 TnT: very interesting - Shultz
18:54 chenmannmobile: howard
18:54 chenmannmobile: ?
18:54 TnT: let us test the ES 1800 from a while back shall we?
18:54 VolCrush: yah i have /nq going lower, not seeing upside here
18:55 VolCrush: especially once der fruit reports 
18:55 tommyo: Any thoughts on how those with $ on the sidelines should ease or jump back in?
18:56 amalia: I'm giving it a couple days/weeks more, tommy.
18:56 tmoney20g: chen, any word from rebecca ?
18:56 tommyo: Looking for more downside, Amalia?
18:56 chenmannmobile: lol tmoney
18:56 chenmannmobile: u missed it i guess
18:56 tmoney20g: wonder if she got out pre-er
18:57 chenmannmobile: she was here
18:57 TnT: as a point of interest, central banks were buying us stocks in recent years, an unprecidented activity that is not good
18:57 tmoney20g: oh ?
18:57 chenmannmobile: held every thing and said lost 500k
18:57 chenmannmobile: but who knows, think she s a joke
18:57 tmoney20g: lollllllll
18:58 tmoney20g: yea, her 100k acct w/ 300k margin and has no idea what she's doing
18:58 TnT: was papertrade account, but still....
18:58 chenmannmobile: she said it was real
18:58 tmoney20g: now that'd be even more funny
18:58 tmoney20g: if she was paper the whole time and hasn't actually lost anything
18:58 amalia: haha
18:59 amalia: Her husband switched it to papermoney and didn't tell her now she's worried about telling him.
18:59 tmoney20g: quite the plot twist
18:59 chenmannmobile: if i lost 500k last thing i do is come in here and talk about it, but if i made 500k this will the first place ....ha
18:59 amalia: lol
19:01 TnT: in the end, no matter, it is just a chat room distraction
19:01 RandomDan: that's the awesome thing, it could be real, or complete invention
19:01 VolCrush: welp hopefully she did not lose that amount
19:01 tommyo: Any legacy Scottrade folks that might know if Learning Markets is still doing a Daily Market Commentary on a platform anywhere?

19:05 chenmannmobile: but next week maybe
19:06 tmoney20g: wow, that typhoon is cat 5, 180mph winds
19:06 VolCrush: asia market in 54 min
19:07 TnT: 150 sustined
19:09 TnT: but yeah, was 180
19:09 TnT: sustained
19:09 RandomDan: if she did lose it, she claims she has a million left.
19:10 TnT: anyone who manages to lose 1/3 in 2 weeks not using any logic
19:11 tmoney20g: how'd tanya do
19:11 tmoney20g: hope she recoups some losses somehow
19:12 Baff: Futures
19:12 tmoney20g: Pasts
19:13 TnT: when throwing big money without experience and knowlege about money management, stuff happens
19:13 chenmannmobile: es 2666 coming
19:14 radon224: "Her" posts had Troll written all over them, imo.
19:15 chenmannmobile: staying up late trading futs radon?
19:15 TnT: that too
19:15 ameriman: I think it is one of the “Anonymous so far” trader pulling leg
19:16 radon224: No, I want to watch Asia Open
19:16 radon224: Japan open now
19:16 TnT: /vx on hgihgs
19:16 TnT: highs
19:17 ameriman: He/she was on mobile using the rebecca name
19:17 TnT: /nkd down 155
19:18 radon224: but Nikkei Index is +140
19:18 radon224: according to what I watch
19:19 tmoney20g: bloom says nikkei +154
19:20 ameriman: Must be news from earlier today when it was up
19:20 radon224: I have a pretty good source for RT Index info on all the world markets.  It's handy
19:21 TnT: all about change from  yesterday, so Nikkei up, but /NKD down compared to US futures closing
19:21 radon224: correct
19:22 TheOnceAndFuture: Guessing it will follow today's US trend
19:23 efu: n 225  up 201
19:23 tommyo: So many issues WAY down aftermarket...did some of the earnings disappoint or is there another catalyst taking place?
19:24 tmoney20g: some earnings dissappointed, yes
19:25 chenmannmobile: besides intc and cmg, all were bad,,,
19:25 chenmannmobile: on my watch list anyway
19:25 Sam: Amazon disappointed earning bring stocks down in eve hours
19:25 chenmannmobile: yes
19:25 TheOnceAndFuture: I wouldn't say they dissappointed so much as the market's expectations are way too high
19:26 Sam: But market will come back tommorrow.
19:26 TheOnceAndFuture: Truly, the quarterly reports are now a burden rather than a boon
19:27 tommyo: AMZN summary bubble says 3.77 was the estimate, 5.75 actual!!!  Must have had some guidance that was less than encouraging...
19:27 TnT: as rates rise, other investments become more competitive
19:27 Sam: Agree but now a days people needs to see nit beat earned ng along witg dales but 2018 future guidrnce. Any numbers werk, good stocks taking hit.
19:27 TheOnceAndFuture: These stocks were much more inflated than their peers IMO
19:28 TheOnceAndFuture: AMD is a case example
19:28 blondetrader: Let’s hope for those lows in am
19:28 TheOnceAndFuture: Lows and thn perhaps buying will resume
19:28 radon224: You gonna jinx it again bt
19:28 TheOnceAndFuture: Still sticking to that
19:28 blondetrader: Then we can at least put lows to rest
19:28 tmoney20g: yea
19:28 tmoney20g: i like buying calls better anyway
19:28 blondetrader: Lol I am mkt just needs to see it my way
19:29 Sam: Semiconductor stocks, stay away
19:29 blondetrader: If we can get them and close over key levels we can get a good rally
19:29 blondetrader: 1-3 weeks
19:29 tmoney20g: rally starts monday
19:30 tmoney20g: we can wash this week off friday at 4pm
19:30 radon224: A bazillion traders are waiting for a low open, retest of some key lows, and then jump in.  So it's not gonna happen.
19:30 radon224: I'm cynical this evening
19:30 TheOnceAndFuture: I say mid to late next week
19:30 Sam: Fed needs to sliw diwn and tarrifs is killer. Semiconductir will bounce back once tarrifs is settled.
19:30 tmoney20g: ok, how about nov 1
19:30 TheOnceAndFuture: small bounce, and then retesting of yesterday
19:31 blondetrader: Lol well I think retail may get spooked and a new low
19:31 TnT: way weird after 8 years peeps just think it should keep going up and no bear mkt ever again, very funny
19:31 tmoney20g: still have earnings till mid nov
19:31 TnT: tarrifs are not the issue
19:31 Sam: Costco earning??
19:31 TnT: markets have cycles
19:31 blondetrader: Well es closes over 65 tomorrow regardless of intraday
19:32 amalia: oh?
19:32 blondetrader: Where inteaday
19:33 TheOnceAndFuture: earnings will bounce us to around mid-september levels before a further correction beginning next year
19:33 blondetrader: Well I think 2850s need to be revisited
19:33 chenmannmobile: wow
19:33 blondetrader: And if that breaks new highs possible
19:34 blondetrader: That level should be new decision point via weekly
19:34 chenmannmobile: only if china deal
19:34 chenmannmobile: imo
19:34 TheOnceAndFuture: I think so too
19:34 TheOnceAndFuture: only if there's good news regarding tariffs
19:35 blondetrader: Well China would do the trick
19:35 TnT: I need a drag off of whatever you peeps are smoking
19:35 chenmannmobile: ha
19:35 TheOnceAndFuture: heh
19:35 chenmannmobile: i m kinda with u tnt
19:35 chenmannmobile: bt s the big bull
19:36 blondetrader: Haha
19:36 TnT: bt, Xi not gonna do nuttin til after election
19:36 blondetrader: Well I make no prediction over 2850
19:36 TheOnceAndFuture: I'm not as optimistic as bt but after what we saw in 2017 I believe these millis will pump anything
19:36 blondetrader: But if we get these stupid lows we go
19:36 chenmannmobile: mid term, fed, china .....just too much unknows out there
19:37 TheOnceAndFuture: where do you see the floor?
19:37 blondetrader: Nq 6740isg
19:37 TnT: fed hike is in Dec, they may not want to interfere with santa claus, but then again...
19:37 TheOnceAndFuture: you think they'll back off?
19:37 chenmannmobile: fed loco
19:38 blondetrader: Es a smidge lower than yest
19:38 blondetrader: Rty possible 1450s
19:38 TnT: they could back off if major market sell off
19:38 tmoney20g: fed cares not
19:38 blondetrader: But the reversal would need to be quick off that
19:38 blondetrader: Like a veee bottom
19:39 radon224: Fed will hike in Dec.  If they don't, it's because some sort of DOOM occured between now and then.
19:39 TnT: wall street cries, they go oh, sorry
19:39 TnT: yes radon, that is what I am saying
19:39 chenmannmobile: like the last half hour yesterday?...look what happened today
19:39 TnT: downturn in market, they will fold
19:39 blondetrader: Regardless we need to be ready either way
19:39 fred__w: bt  what r u wigged out about?
19:39 chenmannmobile: ha
19:40 blondetrader: I am in party city getting my daughter a costume for a party tonight
