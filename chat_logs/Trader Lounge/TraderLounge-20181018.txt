13:02 Nube: bk, how hard would it be to delete the minus sign and try it.
13:03 bkstrader: Just did Nube no luck
13:03 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current.
13:05 JohnnyQuotron: Question.. has anyone scripted a scan for the Gaussian Self Adjusting RSI Laguerre with FE?  I will try if not.
13:09 JohnnyQuotron: bks.  trouble shoot.. try a bubble with just the adx...  then try another with just the other variable data one by one  create debug labels for each bit of variable data you want in the bubble.  
13:09 Nube: bk, did you use the incorrect syntax that is in the post at :03?
13:09 JohnnyQuotron: Is the bubble in the proper xy location?
13:10 anees: hello , is there a way to get the floor pivot points, i get the pre programmed pivots and they arent accurate thanks
13:10 Nube: If you use the correct syntax and index the y value back the same distance you index the x value, you will have data
13:10 JohnnyQuotron: anees check mobius my trade or the community one note
13:11 anees: where is that

13:13 bkstrader: Thanks JohnnyQ, That's where I'm headed The bubble is in the right location. I was hoping with the skills in this room there might be quick. Time to roll up the sleeves tonight
13:13 bkstrader: Nube That gives me anothe direction to try
13:14 JohnnyQuotron: debug the variables one at a time in the bubble. Trust Nube
13:14 bkstrader: JQ I know , Nube has helped may times in the past
13:15 anees: i dont get what i am supposed to do here
13:15 anees: but thank you
13:15 JohnnyQuotron: anees
13:15 JohnnyQuotron: which method
13:15 JohnnyQuotron: which source
13:16 anees: i dont know all i know its called floor pivot points , i saw they were pretty accurate and wanted to ask if they are available for tos because i already have them on DAS
13:17 JohnnyQuotron: are you in the onenote?
13:17 JohnnyQuotron: are you in mobius mytrade?
13:17 anees: yeah
13:18 JohnnyQuotron: which
13:18 anees: one note
13:19 JohnnyQuotron: support resistance section?
13:19 anees: ok
13:20 anees: oh i see them
13:20 JohnnyQuotron: 2. Pivot Scripts... there are 30 of them  Floor Trader Pivots may be a place to start
13:21 anees: yeah im gonna try all of them
13:21 anees: thank you so much
13:21 JohnGalt82: Hi - Wondering if this is built in TOS or has been shared.  Looking to plot swing lines that cross back and forth over a moving average
13:21 JohnnyQuotron: that's what its there for.  Hope you find what ou want. :)
13:22 anees: thanbks johnny appreciate it pal
13:22 JohnnyQuotron: may the code be with you...
13:30 sugar: does anyone know how to use the scan for donchian? I want to scan the ATRSX with close? or send me a copy of the scan.
13:33 JohnnyQuotron: sugar..chart strategy Donchian_Channel DOWNtrend: http://tos.mx/chn8QV# 
chart strategy Donchian_Channel UPtrend: http://tos.mx/ZR7BfU# 
13:33 JohnnyQuotron: scan section of the onenote..search for donchian
13:34 sugar: johnnyquotron: it states the URL is broken for both
13:34 JohnnyQuotron: oops my mistake.. those are strategies.. duh
13:34 sugar: johnnyquotron: it's ok you are already helping me out- so ithere a way?
13:35 Mobius: Johnny - There's an RSI Laguerre in MyTrade. The Gaussian version won't scan - Too Complex
13:35 Mobius: RSI Laguerre Scan in MyTrade
13:35 sugar: Mobius: can you send me the RSI Laguerre scan?
13:36 Mobius: no go get it from MyTrade
13:36 sugar: Mobius: where do you get mytrade?
13:37 sugar: Mobius: is that in think & swim?
13:37 Mobius: Right click ANY uers name and go the profile.
13:37 JohnnyQuotron: Mobius.. yes i have that and use it.  But with many etfs and S&P500 stocks i find the gaussian keeps me in the trade longer.    I'm a huge fan. Wonder if it will scan without the FE component?
13:37 Mobius: nope Johnny it will not
13:41 sugar: Mobius & Johnnyquontron: can I run a scan with donchain (ATRSX) with close?
13:43 JohnnyQuotron: mobius... bummer bummer bummer
13:47 Mobius: Johnny - This will scan.
Something in the scanner has changed since I wrote the original. It wouldn't scan then but I just checked and doesn now.

13:48 Mobius: The scan  reference was to the Study name and main plot crossing 0
13:48 Mobius: 8 returns on the S&P 500
13:49 Mobius: Well that would make a couple thousand TOS traders happy to know.
13:53 JohnnyQs_BackupWks: YOU THE MAN !
13:57 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current.  Thank you Mobius and thank you ToS for updating those scan servers. Wahoo...
13:58 bsinks: This has most likely been asked a bazillion times and if so I'm sorry..........Does any body have a link for a good HOD MOMO scanner for TOS
13:58 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - last time that was shared, it had Nfe of 8, Glenght of 13, BetaDev of 4. Now it is configured 5, 13, 8.
Any specific reason for the change. Symbol used on? aggregation period?
14:02 Mobius: Alpha... Just the way I used it last is all
14:02 chief: sugar, this should work as Donchian buy scan....
input length = 50;
plot buy = high > Highest(high[1], length);
14:04 AlphaInvestor: Thanks mobius - the shape and crossing times change of course - I think this is agreat study, one of the best you have done ... so always interested in how/why it works the way it does.
P.S. the math is beyond me
14:07 Mobius: Alpha.. The latest one I've been working on uses an error correction neuron to set the length for the gaussian filter and RSI time factor. Pretty cool.
14:07 AlphaInvestor: oooh, super cool
14:08 AlphaInvestor: I am short a few physical neurons, so software ones are always beneficial
14:08 Mobius: I'll post it when I'm sure it's working correctly
14:08 AlphaInvestor: Great, thanks!
14:08 AlphaInvestor: If yoiu need beta testers ...
14:08 Mobius: I'm sure the group will have a ball twisting and morphing it :)
14:09 bigworm: neuron?
14:09 AlphaInvestor: I rarely touch your studies, except to change the lipstick, or add debug statement so that I can understand how they work
14:10 Mobius: lol  go back to sleep big... 
14:10 ramesh2599: Is it possible to displaly dynamic vertical line  50 bars back?
14:10 AlphaInvestor: yes
14:11 AlphaInvestor: why, would be an appropriate question tho
14:12 MTS1: Ramesh; use barnumber() function and do the math to determine where 50 bars back is. Or index like IsNan(close)[-50]
14:13 Mobius: Quite a bit of /ES volume swapping hands today with no real movement.
14:13 ramesh2599: I am looking into its relationship with  RSI
14:13 Mobius: let me save you some time - There is no relationship with current RSI and RSI 50 bars back
14:14 MTS1: Ramesh; which relationship with RSI?
14:14 ramesh2599: ok
14:15 Mobius: Other than the Butterfly Effect
14:15 MTS1: But 48 bars may work;)
14:15 ramesh2599: 49 to be exact!
14:15 ramesh2599: Thank you all though!!
14:16 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - that is too simplistic - they will both be between 0 and 100
14:16 bigworm: lol i wasnt sleeping.  been up since 6!! had class today to learn about the kernel trick!!!
14:17 bigworm: seems very useful.  I have been looking at code on classifiers and it seems there are alot of ones that are iterative and you need lots of loops.  with kernels, it appears you only need to go over it once
14:17 bigworm: so computationaly, it appears much more effiecient and easy to swap out
14:17 Mobius: You turned left on your way to Walmart last night and because you didn't turn right an accident happened in Russia that killed the one person that could have saved the planet 40 years from now. But the one person that would save the planet 39 years from now was born because if the same turn you made last night.  True Story. 
14:18 bigworm: lol what?
14:19 Vimes: JD?
14:20 Vimes: i thinke he's illustrating the butterfly effect
14:20 bigworm: great movie
14:22 Mobius: String Theory, Chaos Theory, Quantum Entanglement - Spooky Action at a Distance, whatever everything is connected
14:22 bigworm: agree
14:24 Vimes: is it simlar to the kevin bacon theory
14:24 bigworm: mmm
14:24 AlphaInvestor: I know a guy named Kevin, and I like bacon
14:24 Mobius: ohhh bacon...yum
14:26 Mobius: Did you guys read about the kid that just proved that quantum computers are actually doing quantum stuff?
14:26 AlphaInvestor: bacon infused jack daniels - its a thng ... look it up
14:26 Vimes: i've had bacon in bloody mary's , <-_ not ashamed
14:27 bigworm: whats going on with your brain right now
14:27 Mobius: hmm a breakfast idea
14:27 bigworm: quantum bacon stuff?
14:27 mthfr_vaxxed: urmila mahadev?
14:27 Mobius: yep   grad student
14:27 bigworm: lol
14:27 Mobius: smart girl
14:27 Mobius: she will make a difference
14:28 Mobius: TOS needs to hire her  :)
14:28 bigworm: when will they be out?
14:28 bigworm: probably will be too expensive for me
14:29 Mobius: First Quantum Trading Platform.. You guys paying attention
14:29 Vimes: i think i'm in love
14:29 bigworm: im not quick enough to even use a regular computer that efficiently
14:30 AlphaInvestor: I am stuck on a continuous surface with only one side and only one boundary .. I have no time for such banal persuits
14:31 Mobius: I loved one of the illustrations used to describe a core problem with understanding what a quantum computer is doing. One with 100 qbits held in a single state would take a current harddrive the size of the visible universe to hold it's state data.  
14:33 Mobius: How could any human know if that data is correct??
14:34 mthfr_vaxxed: "Mahadev's protocl is unlikely to be implemented in a real quantum computer in the immediate future. For the time being, the protocol requires too much computing power to be practical."
14:34 Mobius: That young woman found a way... That is cool!
14:34 mthfr_vaxxed: sounds like an expensive "trust" function ....
14:35 Mobius: trust isn't an option
14:35 Mobius: Not unless you thing the Terminator would be a nice buddy
14:36 Mobius: think
14:38 NUG: Since TOS changed the futures symbols, I'm wondering if it is possible to use wildcards in thinkscript to compare with the results of the getSymbol() function??
14:38 Mobius: Why wonder. Use Addlabel and find out
14:38 Vimes: terminator 2, i think he was a nice buddy, been a while though
14:39 NUG: For example: current code is if getSymbol() == "/ES:XCME"
14:39 John1a: Does anyone have a script for the Std Channel in TOS that changes the channels color (green, yellow, red) depending on a trend, up, down, neutral. Thank you.
14:39 NUG: can I use if getSymbol() == "/ES*" ?
14:40 AlphaInvestor: Nug - you can use it, but I don't hink it will work any more
14:41 NUG: belly laugh
14:41 NUG: then why use it?
14:41 NUG: wish they'd leave shit alone
14:42 Vimes: i thought it was an exchange thing
14:42 bigworm: when did you stop teaching formally mobius
14:43 NUG: well, then they should code a routine to change the exchange requirements to the old TOS symbols so our code still works
14:50 NUG: Thanks anyway
14:56 AlphaInvestor: Nug - use   /ES:XCME   in your if statement
15:01 rupam: the RTD function for "/vxx18" does not work - any ideas?
15:01 rupam: i.e. RTD("tos.rtd",,"LAST","/VXX18") returns an error
15:02 Up_n_Up: put it on a watchlist and export it and stop futzing with the Excel side
15:02 rupam: hmm
15:03 AlphaInvestor: use      "/VXX18:XCBF"
15:05 rupam: aha! thanks...
15:09 Up_n_Up: watchlist columns that get exported somehow magically have the correct syntax, it's .... increeeedable...
15:09 chief: Never mind grad students and quantum computers. This is the headline that should get more attention  "New research suggests that climate change could trigger a global shortage of beer. " 
15:15 Taurean: Hey could somebody help me with a study as to when the Stochasitc RSI on the 5 minute chart goes above overbought or oversold and the Average line and the Value line are both greater than or less than the previous on the 30 minute chart please
15:18 Mobius: cheif - That is serious
15:20 Mobius: big.. I retired full time teaching 20 years ago. I had a grad student course up until 2 yrs ago and a couple students finishing last year.
15:20 Taurean: Hey Mobius could you give me a hand with my above statement if you dont mind?
15:21 Mobius: Taurean.. For a scan that can be done with the scan wizard easily.
15:21 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - how the heck old are you, are you in your 200's yet?
15:21 Mobius: lol  close
15:21 AlphaInvestor: retired 20 years ago, dats a long time ago
15:22 Mobius: Some of us don't wait till we're 70 to retire you know
15:23 AlphaInvestor: I dream of retiring that early
15:25 MTS1: @180???
15:25 Mobius: Alpha... There's this little thing called trading. Try that and you'll never go to an office again.  :)
15:26 AlphaInvestor: never heard tell of that kinda thing ... how would one learn how to do that?
15:27 Up_n_Up: somebody told me it was hard once
15:28 Mobius: We've traded two inside days since the "Big Red One". How often does that happen and what typically happens next?
15:29 Up_n_Up: sounds like today's pop quiz
15:35 AlphaInvestor: I would bet that the 3rd day after Big Red is not an inside day
15:35 AlphaInvestor: BUT, if I knew the answer, I might just become a trader
15:37 Taurean: Im going to put this on the 5 minute chart...can someone tell me where i went wrong?
15:38 Taurean: StochRSI("rsi length" = 10, "k period" = 10, "slowing period" = 3, "average type" = "EXPONENTIAL")."FullK" crosses below StochRSI("rsi length" = 10, "k period" = 10, "slowing period" = 3, "average type" = "EXPONENTIAL")."OverSold"
MACDTwoLines(aggregationPeriod.THIRTY_MIN)."Value" is greater than MACDTwoLines(aggregationPeriod.THIRTY_MIN)."Value" from 1 bars ago and MACDTwoLines(aggregationPeriod.THIRTY_MIN)."Avg" is greater than MACDTwoLines(aggregationPeriod.THIRTY_MIN)."Avg" from 1 bars ago
15:39 New_Trade: Mobius plese, please open teaching trading room
15:42 AlphaInvestor: Taurean - split that into 2 or more separate conditions, then use
plot Scan = cond1 and cond2 and cond3'
15:42 New_Trade: 2 inside days and VIX = 21.30....
15:42 chief: There is a small pennant on the spy which is usually a continuation pattern. Break to the downside suggests 257 spy
15:43 Nube: I support Mobius having a teaching room but only open by invite to those with the sufficient foundation and desire as determined by the Selection Committee of One.
15:45 AlphaInvestor: Nube - do you chair the SCoO?
15:45 New_Trade: but  scripting is not mandatory...   LOL
15:45 novapawshere: I cant get an alert that occurs when one moving average crosses anohter moving average to work? can someone help me figure out why this may be?
15:45 amalia: 5/29,5/30&5/31 was last InsideBar
15:46 Up_n_Up: ok ,and then what happened?
15:46 amalia: The bottoming happened and we shot up.
15:47 amalia: 4.91% up before we formed a top
15:48 AlphaInvestor: Amalia - i'm game
15:48 Nube: M does.
15:48 novapawshere: anyone willing to hlep?
15:49 AlphaInvestor: Nova - Chart Alert, Marketwatch Alert, or Dynamic Watchlist Alert?
15:49 Nube: Don't get me wrong, I'm glad we don't have that - I'd have never learned to script.
15:49 novapawshere: marketwatch alert
15:49 AlphaInvestor: so for a single symbol
15:50 novapawshere: Like i do if this moving average of 5 periods crosses this moving average of 9 periods alert me. Activates but never alerts when they do cross
15:50 novapawshere: also i do alert if 'true'
15:51 New_Trade: amalia  on 5/29 - 5/31 /ES was above 50 MA and now we below 200 MA
15:52 novapawshere: I feel like it must have something to do with the chart timeframes because  moving averages are different if your looking at a 5m vs 15m but there is no way to select one within alert options as far as i can tell
15:52 slashgw: there should be the option
15:53 novapawshere: where?
15:53 slashgw: when creating the alert
15:53 novapawshere: how confident are you in that?
15:54 slashgw: https://screencast.com/t/R5h1wzt6
15:54 novapawshere: ahh
15:55 novapawshere: i just cant find it in the options though
15:55 novapawshere: wait
15:55 slashgw: https://screencast.com/t/QewgbCq9yeo8
15:55 novapawshere: the live support guy just found it for me
15:55 AlphaInvestor: So, do you have a Study Alert something lke this:
MovingAvgCrossover(length1 = 5, length2 = 9, "crossing type" = "below")
15:55 novapawshere: yeah
15:56 novapawshere: sweet i think that will fix it
15:56 slashgw: cool. goodluck
15:56 novapawshere: thankss slashgw and alphainvester
15:56 novapawshere: you guys rock

16:41 DSF_TX: Could someone help me with a script for a scan .  I want to scan for the 8 ema to be above the 34 ema for 21 days or more.
16:41 DSF_TX: I was able to write the script without the timeframe.  but want to add the 21 day timeframe.
16:42 AlphaInvestor: Combining a Momentum indicator .. and a Choppiness indicator, and looking for where they cross ... hmmm
16:42 AlphaInvestor: share what you have
16:43 FrankB3: Yep,, its called RSI Lagear
16:44 FrankB3:   already been done by Mr. Mo
16:45 AlphaInvestor: Frank - good point

16:47 Vimes: that has about a 50% chance of working
16:48 Nube: The swing from 0 to 1 or visa versa on the LG RSI is fast enough that often it will cross .5 and OB or OS on the same bar so it's likely not a bad cross to take as a signal.
16:48 Nube: Not because the cross itself is special, but the speed makes most crosses about the same
16:49 Donnie: Do they have a screener for the mobile app? Or just the pc
16:50 Vimes: Not sure on the screener part, but i know you can save a screen based watchlist and access it via mobile
16:51 AlphaInvestor: Nube - I configure mine to cross slower ... more of an oscillator, not a yes/no signal
16:51 Nube: Ah, then that would be a different beast
16:52 AlphaInvestor: I know that Mobius likes it to be more of a signal ... because he uses it for program trading
16:53 AlphaInvestor: I prefer the gray area ... when used as an oscillator
16:54 amalia: Donnie, the built in one are pretty good and accessible on mobile. If you prefer a custom one, create one on desktop, save it under a name then you can access the screener on mobile.
16:55 amalia: *ones
17:02 Nube: There's for sure a legitimate reason to want an indication to be an on / off switch. I make my final trade decisions based on a couple of yes or no criteria so it's clear cut. But screening before I get to the yes or no stage is entirely different matter, and one I do not want switch type indicators for.
17:06 TICKZ: Im trying to make a grid to look at the global markets..but I can't find the tickers.. Can Anyone help me plz? or any Ideas?
17:13 chief: tickz...just do a googl search on country etfs
17:14 TICKZ: ok. thanks
17:15 slashgw: also look at cme futures
17:15 TICKZ: like? /6a/6b/6e etc ?
17:15 Nube: Tickz, check out the ishares website. They have ETFs for most counties in the EAFE and the EEM
17:15 slashgw: sure, currencies as well as /NKD and I'm sure there are others
17:16 slashgw: checkout their website to see what all is available
17:16 Nube: ewt, Eden, qat etc etc
17:16 TICKZ: Ok. Thanks guys!
17:25 amalia: Just trade MinRange on /YM.
17:25 mthfr_vaxxed: amalia : did you prepare?
17:26 mthfr_vaxxed: i think your one of the few who listens to my crazy anticts
17:28 amalia: =)
17:30 hguru: How do you scan on the mobile app what am o missing ?
17:32 amalia: I listen to contributors. My leaning towards shortcuts in tS comes from BLT/Mobius, long term books are similar to AlphaInvestor, my daytrading is similar to Mobius’ ORB, my curiosity behind the veil in studies from Nube, etc.
17:33 Nube: Save a scan on desktop and it will be a watchlist on mobile
17:34 hguru: Hum ok I have a bunch of watch lists
17:35 hguru: Your talking scan results becomes a watchlist I get that
17:43 MTS1: Save it as a query and it becomes a 'live' scan / watchlist that updates in mobile.
17:43 MTS1: (Don't just save the output as a watchlist)
17:44 MTS1: Those dynamic watchlists / queries have a pink symbol in front of them on desktop.
17:46 MTS1: (OR green; believe those are option hacker scans)
17:58 hguru: Hum ok thx
18:03 inov: hello..i am writing a simple study alert like below and when I receive the Alert msg, I dont get the text "SimMovAvg_Greater", instead a portion of the code is shown, can one of you help
18:03 inov: def agg = AggregationPeriod.DAY;
plot cPrice = close(period = agg);
plot savg = close > simpleMovingAvg(cPrice,20);
Alert (savg, "SimMovAvg_Greater");
18:08 TICKZ: Nube.. im using your "LABLE" script to add the countrys name.. i change the studie name..but it keeps changing other lables... can you help me plz?
18:09 TICKZ:  
18:10 Up_n_Up: inov, if the syntax is right, contact support and tell them Alert is broken
18:10 TICKZ:  
18:11 Up_n_Up: I guess the obvious question is how did you change it?
18:12 amalia: Buy /YM
18:13 TICKZ: i changed the script name for each country.. thinking it will stp changing other countrys name..
18:14 Up_n_Up: the name of the script has nothing to do with what gets displayed
18:14 Up_n_Up: lounge rule #12 - you can't have your own syntax
18:14 TICKZ:  
18:15 Up_n_Up: that will ALWAYS display Saudi Arabia, no matter what the chart, but then you know that by now
18:15 TICKZ: hah yeah
18:17 Up_n_Up: the one means always display the text string
18:18 slashgw: should be able to take a vote on the syntax one
18:18 TICKZ: I gtg... Thanks
18:18 Up_n_Up: lol slash
18:22 DMonkey: tickz....you will need to use getsymbol() aand use an if then statement....
18:25 Up_n_Up: well not really right  addlbl(getsym()=="whatever", "whatevertxt");
18:26 Up_n_Up: so much fun to make up your own syntax....   :)
18:28 amalia: lol Wish it worked like that.
19:37 John1a: Is there a way to change the color of the columns in the price ladder DOM? I've screen shots with different colors for Bis Size column and other columns, but I cannot find a setting for it. Or is it no longer an option in the current version?
19:45 DMonkey: example....this is one way to accomplish.....you pick your symbols & what you want the text to display.....
addlabel(1,if getsymbol() == "SPY" then "SPY" else if getsymbol() == "XOM" then "Exxon Mobile" else "" + getsymbol());
19:48 admin_tculs: thinkScript Lounge chatroom will be closing soon   Please finish all conversations by 8pm ct   Have a nice evening

17:41 VolCrush: well my intuition @momo has always been counter trend / herd since i was a kid, so my NORM is not the norm
17:41 VolCrush: see my tt:40 post
17:41 VolCrush: not so sure, @amalia chit luks weak
17:42 vinny: because you have a reached a  fib extension or  other possible resistance point
17:42 vinny: then even though could go further, you bail
17:43 VolCrush: or an Orange Swan
17:43 momo: vinny in da house
17:43 vinny: hey !
17:43 blondetrader: extension tighten the x for sure
17:43 vinny: i enjoy following bt and amelia

17:45 momo: no that must’ve been different
17:45 vinny: with
17:45 vinny: oh bummer
17:45 vinny: :)
17:46 VolCrush: meh, feel free to tongue anyways
17:47 amalia: 25690 is SellSignal on MinRange so we’ll see if /YM will repeat yesterday’s action by bouncing off possible resistance
17:47 vinny: haha vol
17:47 VolCrush: dat damn round num on /nq is gunna go on all night
17:48 vinny: im long /ym amelia, hmm
17:48 VolCrush: @amalia, i'm gunna go with fear and greed wins der next week on /nq to der upside
17:49 vinny: maybe i should sell there and reload lower
17:49 VolCrush: wat was the plan?
17:49 vinny: the plan is to hold long and add  if it gets cheaper
17:49 vinny: suck it up in the meantime
17:50 vinny: over the next several weeks
17:50 VolCrush: interesting
17:50 momo: what if it keeps going down?
17:50 amalia: Permabull
17:51 vinny: but so choppy may as well scalp some ??
17:51 VolCrush: buy more
17:51 amalia: The possibility of a year long beer market is sooner than later
17:51 Eedie: I agree with that Amalia
17:51 vinny: no doubt amelia
17:51 VolCrush: yup
17:51 VolCrush: prob gunna start on Nov 1
17:51 vinny: but I think this is a mere correction
17:52 VolCrush: wit lost of vol on Nov 6
17:52 amalia: Whatever the reason is, vinny, it's happening.
17:52 VolCrush: and then we make der mula 
17:52 vinny: i didn't give a reason
17:52 vinny: vol did
17:53 VolCrush: yes, yes i did........a stated my plan
yes, yes i did
17:53 vinny: )
17:53 vinny: he talking elction
17:53 vinny: mid term election vol?
17:53 amalia: So this is my guesstimate, where a lot of people think a bearmarket is below ATH-(15-20%) , I think this bear market will just be oscillation.
17:53 VolCrush: or sumtin before : 0
17:54 amalia: And if the market is inverted, the season of less vol between Nov-Jan will mean drops
17:54 VolCrush: welp there are several catalyst in the mean time, and we will adjst our plan accordingly
17:55 amalia: Si.
17:55 amalia: A thousand time si
17:55 vinny: a trade with China would screw the shorts
17:55 vinny: royally
17:55 vinny: so until that happens, i wouldn't get carried away
17:55 VolCrush: i like Royal Shorts
17:56 vinny: ya
17:57 Eedie: I like short royals
17:57 vinny: the end of qe changed things bigly but we have been adjusting to that for a while  gradually
17:57 vinny: i miss qe
17:58 vinny: aunty yellen
17:58 vinny: but hey time to wear big boy pants
17:58 VolCrush: i don't , it happened we profited and moved on........as expected

17:59 vinny: volcrush open to changes
17:59 vinny: true bro
17:59 vinny: i get stuck
17:59 VolCrush: best part was the amount of peeps that kept shorting in 2017
18:00 vinny: looking forward to better times
18:00 vinny: that was the 'smart $"
18:00 vinny: lol
18:01 vinny: with all due respect to the terchnicals, sometimes you have to throw charts to the wind
18:02 amalia: no
18:02 amalia: imo
18:03 vinny: just trying to get a post of ya :)
18:03 vinny: fropm you :)
18:03 RandomDan: nice convo here today
18:03 vinny: it was crickets except vol and me
18:03 G3_: vinny- charts are maps.  Nothing more.
18:04 VolCrush: only thing that matters is the tape
18:04 vinny: i look at charts all day ( and night) on various time frames
18:04 vinny: tools of the trade
18:04 VolCrush: funnies, fibs, technicals, systems, programmes
won't mean chit when u have to pull the trigger
18:05 G3_: If you trade on AT ladder you can see p/a.  That is the tape
18:07 mike: what do u think will happen tomordow in AAL
18:08 RandomDan: funny you ask that
18:08 mike: ?
18:09 RandomDan: earlier someone asked about AA, and I started talking about AAL.
18:10 mike: I sold some weekly 35 calls for 75 cents 10 contracts
18:10 mike: at open
18:11 RandomDan: so short
18:11 mike: ya
18:11 RandomDan: can't say I disagree
18:13 RandomDan: lots of headwinds for it
18:25 amalia: So I was gone for a bit writing up a script strategy using MinRange Trailing Stop, similar to the ATRTrailingStop strategy.
18:25 amalia: Here's the last 15D15m chart with P/L
18:25 amalia: http://tos.mx/uTL3zP#
18:25 blondetrader: back
18:27 amalia: Worst drawdown was -115ticks (-$575 per contract) and best trade was +483ticks (+$2,415 per contract). 
18:27 blondetrader: nice
18:34 Anonymous so far: pfe starting to make a move before earning. buy or sell ?
18:35 G3_: /es 10:45 candle revesal was big.  BT call that support prior.  Good call.
18:36 VolCrush: u use OnDemand to backtest tat?
18:37 WYCOWBOY: anyone know how to list call options on Marketwatch screen?
18:37 G3_: u asking me vol?  I covered short and posted at that time.
18:37 amalia: No, TOS' strategy report/skills isn't backtesting worthy but gives you an idea to run with.
18:38 amalia: And the study doesn't repaint/change so levels are set before anything happens like reversals or expansion.
18:38 VolCrush: k, ty
18:38 amalia: Mom's got dinner ready for me so I'll be back later.
18:38 amalia: =)
18:39 momo: 2784 was exactly 1 x daily ATR move
18:39 VolCrush: cheers, amalia
18:39 amalia: buy /ym if you got the balls here.
18:40 amalia: http://www.screencast.com/t/luKlMTPrwi
18:40 G3_: sadly, I did not reverse at that time
18:40 momo: I had that daily ATR line drawn at 2784 from the open bell
18:40 VolCrush: @anon, PFE was a buy on 10/16 at 8 a.m. PST, now R:R isn't so gud with lil upside IMO, i would not hit it
18:40 momo: Then tape reacted favorably at that level
18:52 gadger: I told people about wdrp yesterday. this stock is going to move people
18:53 MotoX: soon as it goes out of biz?
18:55 amalia: Thanks gadger! I don’t know what I’d do without you. I’m definitely selling my Lexus and using the funds to purchase WDRP tomorrow at the open of RTH.
19:02 G3_: gadger you are in the wrong room
19:04 amalia: He left after he posted.
19:05 G3_: a fool and his money... wonder how they got together to begin with.
19:09 gadger: sell your lexus. hahahahaha
19:10 amalia: I am!
19:10 amalia: bt, this is one of those non-positive trades
19:11 gadger: oh I see
19:13 amalia: That’s good.
19:13 amalia: Always nice to be able to see.
19:13 gadger: g3. I got it by hard work. saved up 5k and started trading penny stocks and now doing very well. invest in local business in my town but hey, I'm a fool trying to give advice
19:14 gadger: Lexus though. LMAO
19:14 amalia: gadger, don’t expect the benefit of a doubt. We’re online and we’re all avatars to each other so mind the skepticism with no report.
19:15 gadger: Ok all, good day
19:15 amalia: At least an Entry/Stop/Target and maybe you won’t be brushed off as a pump/dumper
19:15 amalia: Peace out.
19:15 G3_: my reference was to trading penny weed stocks.  Easy to get in, then where is your target?
19:16 gadger: my entry was at .005 and my target is .06
19:16 amalia: Where our entry if you’re front loading?
19:16 G3_: fair enough. where is yor stop?
19:16 amalia: *Where’s
19:17 fred__w: vinny  on throwing charts to the wind  there are ways to analyze charts in any mkt  incl this one
19:17 G3_: ahh.  no stop then
19:17 joshua8446: hey so im trying to change me account to real time ive already subscribed but it hasnt changed what should i do

08:18 vinny: alright
08:20 blondetrader: support rn on 00 if it break rotation should continue to 88
09:49 ruffle: Trying to find newly IPO&aposd stocks
09:49 ruffle: Or IPO within x number of days
09:50 MTS1: Ruffle; that's quite  different than your earlier example; what does that statement mean in plain english? 
09:50 MTS1: In any casep if there is no bar 100 days ago there is no close; but that's different than NaN
09:51 MTS1: NaN means there is a 'bar 'but no value for close; like the expansion area. If you want items with less than 100 bars simply use BarNumber() function
09:52 ruffle: Is appendix d wrong? OHLC values of the current symbol are NaN when a script tries to retrieve them from the time point before IPO or before the first visible bar on tick and range charts. The same happens when the script tries to retrieve OHLC values from the right expansion of the chart (i.e., from the time point in the "future", which doesn&apost have any OHLC values yet).
09:52 Mobius: Arianna - It's impossible for you to offend me. My statement stands regardless of your past use.  Zscore is a simple indicator of where price is in a standard deviation envelope. The levels are simple reminders of excepted standards. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 standard deviations from the mean.  If you knew what you were looking at you'd have known that
09:53 MTS1: Nope; example from D rowks fine
09:53 Ariana3: Mobius: I know that, I asked how to write in the code.
09:54 ruffle: Seems like you&aposre telling me "OHLC values of the current symbol are NaN when a script tries to retrieve them from the time point before IPO or before the first visible bar on tick and range charts" is not true?
09:54 ruffle: Is not true?
09:54 Mobius: I gave you the code.  The only thing you need to do is add
plot one = 1;
plot two = 2;
plot three = 3;
09:55 MTS1: Debug it Ruffle and check it out; I also gave you a solution I know works.
09:55 Ariana3: Mobius: Thank you very much!
09:57 Mobius: Just as a reminder -
We don't work for TOS. We're traders interested in helping other traders to learn to code. We appreciate those that try to learn. Those that just want a code because they don't know how to code are encouraged to learn to code. Anyone can that works at it a bit.
09:59 ruffle: Ok I&aposll try that. Still puzzling to me why the other way doesn&apost work. Seems like exactly what app d is stating!
09:59 Mobius: ruffle - keep at it - the light will shine just before the train hits you
10:00 ruffle: Thanks guys & thanks Möbius I was starting to think you might work for ToS! Ya&aposll are really awesome for helping us!
10:09 inov: hello Mobius...thanks for ur reply but I would like to know the highest intraday volume, let's say around 1:00 p.m or any time before end of RTH.....any tips on how to code will be helpful
10:21 Vimes: inov, what you are requesting will predominatly be the open or close as mobius said, it could be coded as you requested, but maybe as an alternative look at this "high volume node" code from Mobius:
# High Volume Nodes
# V01.02.2018
# Looks for the highest volume candle in "n" periods and plots the candle range. 
# As Volatility increases this study has two values. Plotting a current high volume node as a channel which price will be drawn back to and test since a very high volume node will move price quickly, and price will retest that area. And, with the legacy plots a way to quickly see if larger traders, those that can generate a high volume node, are accumulating or distributing inventory. 
input n = 20;
input LegacyPoints = yes;
def h = high;
def l = low;
def c = close;
def v = volume;

10:21 nextrade: that gave me  an interesting idea to propose to TDA. I would think that the small fortune that TDA has spent to attract the 11 million funded accounts - was to increase their profits-not to teach all of us how  to code ; which is in itself a lengthy and to some a fruitless endeavor.I would think most of the 11 million clients just want to place trades ( which is revenue for TDA ) - not to be coders. So- '' Hey TDA - how about hiring a smart coder to help clients design the scripts that they wish to use in trading ''. If it increases their trading activity ( and you make more fees); then you keep the coder in house. If TDA does not see an increase in trading activity- you fire his a_ _.
10:23 Vimes: i think they could do more, but they at least try to stay connected with some developments like TASC and provide those indicators in platform each month
10:23 AlphaInvestor: Next - they have some peeps who do that for High Net Worth and Active Traders -- I know, becuase I know some of those people, not because I am one
10:24 Up_n_Up: how the other half lives
10:26 nextrade: guess i'll have to sell the Farm - to increase my account size -)
10:26 inov: thanks Vimes
10:28 Vimes: np, Mobius is primary to thank as i find alot of use in that indicator
10:30 nextrade: Ai- 20 years ago i was with a broker, and my account rep was a former salesclerk. He non-chalantly told me that he liked working for a broker, because he got to see the big money accounts- and their monetflow
10:32 Mobius: As in much of life - It's not what you know but who you know that often makes the difference.
10:34 AlphaInvestor: I know Mobius ... it has made a huge difference
10:35 AlphaInvestor: Thank you kind sir!
10:35 inov: Thanks Mobius for your help
10:35 Mobius: ha - You need to get out more often  :)
10:36 Nube: Having someone else write my scripts for me does not appeal to me one bit. The wisdom of that has to be inversely proportional to account size.
10:38 AlphaInvestor: Nube - I am more than happy to have you and Mobius write scripts for me!
10:43 Nube: Better be sure, my scripts have me long Turkey and Brazilian Small Caps
10:44 Nube: The good part of that is that if those trades work then ES is going to 5k so we'll all be riding high
10:46 AlphaInvestor: Nube - I think the elections in Brazil will turn those markets, to some extent already have
10:51 Nube: I'm a firm believer in the bullish politics is gridlock
10:51 Nube: So could well be
10:56 Mobius: Seems Brazil is always about something short. Brazillian Bikini, Brazillian Wax ......... Maybe Short is just a better idea
10:57 Nube: I ain't bullish on this thing their century, so maybe I should hedge...
10:59 online1: @Alpha or others - is it possible to have this scan show results for the net change starting from the 9:30 open?  I have no idea how to do modify.
http://tos.mx/6jbtdI#
couldn't sshot as was too bid and then couldn't see if made smaller
11:23 Nube: Watching what we do here like a hawk.
11:36 New_Trade: I just would like to follow Mobius trades...So many scripts only confusing but following big money...would be great   Better learning experience 
11:36 MTS1: Online; looks like you shared a wachlist, not a scan query or the script. Look at Mobius' ORB script for example of checking if the time has passed (Active) so you can retain the open so you can use it to compare with current close to calc net change.
11:37 MTS1: Agreed NT; good attitude. Not just see the trades though; understand trade decisions.
11:38 New_Trade: Yes I need to learn a lot
11:40 New_Trade: So would be great to ask Mobius to have teaching and trading room  He learned from his dad....
11:41 MTS1: He already spends as much time here as he likes;)
11:41 New_Trade: Agree he is helping a lot
11:41 MTS1: He's retired you know; in the right way it sounds like: Doing what he enjoys;)
11:44 New_Trade: It is very hard to learn by myself.    Zillions scripts not really helping.   I would like to find a better way to learn to make money
11:46 AlphaInvestor: In the long run you need no more than a dozen indicators, mosly likely about 6 or so, carefully selected
11:50 New_Trade: And how to use them right way
11:50 AlphaInvestor: Xactly
11:52 MTS1: scripts are just tools to help you see what's happening with price. key is finding what works for you; usually that means lots of chart reading / testing. Then have a trading plan based on what you know statistically works and follow that plan. Record your trading decisions and review those in hindsight to hopefully improve going forward (how you followed / did not follow your plan and how to improve plan / execution). Indicators are probably only a very small part of what it takes to make money...

12:36 amalia: Got it. Thanks librarians
12:45 Vimes: different platform
12:50 online1: MTSI - it is basically this -
 
12:50 online1: but the change is from the close of yesterday and I would like the net change to be from the 9:30 opening
12:51 amalia: What's the formula for net change?
13:05 DMonkey: net change from open....
def o = if secondsFromTime(0930) == 0 
        then open
        else o[1];
plot change = c - o;
13:07 donh: Mobius, Ever since TOS changed the futures to a two digit suffix rather the one,  the SpotRisk study that you created does not seem to work at all.  Can you suggest a fix?  Looking at your code, I only see that the problem may be associated to the GetSymbol()=="/NQ".  Appreciate any suggestion?
13:08 amalia: The mobile friendly version:
def o = if GetTime() crosses RegularTradingStart(GetYYYYMMDD())
then Open
else o[1];
plot change = c- o;
13:09 MTS1: Don; confirm the current value for /NQ in your charting window and update the script with the new value TOS is using now
13:10 MTS1: believe /NQ:XCME for NQ
13:11 donh: MTSI - Thanks I'll try your suggestion.
13:14 amalia: donh, please exit and re-enter the room. Thanks.
13:16 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current.
13:17 donh: MTSI - Thanks again.   Your suggestion worked.
13:18 MTS1: yw
13:20 donh: The room seems choppy and slow even after following Amalia's request t exit and reenter the room.  Logging out for now.  
13:21 MTS1: room seems fine; the logging back in was to fix your font. Sorry (not) if we're too slow to respond;)

13:55 HighDesertZero: I need to read up on referencing one study within another what topic heading would that come under?
13:56 AlphaInvestor: High - you can Reference built-in studies, but not custom user studies
13:57 HighDesertZero: grrrrrrrr, thanks alpha
14:01 amalia: You can use Script{}
14:46 em11: http://tos.mx/ldV5mA#    hi all, can some one direct me on where to find info on how to code the highest and the lowest of the colored interval ... two EMA crossing, highest and lowest of the candles located when fast EMA below slow EMA
14:56 thomas7156: Trying  to create a custom scan code to select stocks which are above the MA midpoint and the Upper_Band of a Keltner Channel. With the MA as a variable zero point the selection channel would fall in a range of about +1.25 and +2.5 times the MA. Here id the thinkscript

15:01 Vimes: really like maybe something with the word "trade" or "trader" in it
15:02 AlphaInvestor: or Worthless, or GoingToZero
15:03 Mobius: Totally Dude
15:03 thomas7156: Mobius gave me the following yesterday  and perhaps I changed something wrong. Any help would be greatly appreciated
15:03 Vimes: do penny stocks even have options, whats teh point
15:04 em11: thank you Mobius, always appreciated
15:05 Mobius: yw
15:06 Mobius: Vimes - This is no place for logic..  Oh wait, maybe it is.  Good point!
15:07 Vimes: if only i could afford 100 shares of this penny stock, oh wait let me buy the options!!
15:10 Mobius: thomas.. the syntax for referencing a study in the scanner is
StudyName()."PlotName"
if your going to change any input in the study that change with the input name has to be added between the parentheses
Example:
StudyName(length = 30)."PlotName"
15:39 Biometrizilla: Have a question about indexing. If I create a new study with def x = x[1]; plot showx = x; then x is always zero. Then if I change to def x=x[1]+1; and plot, x starts at 2 and increases by one for each bar. I thought that defining x sets it to zero so x[1]+1 should start at 1. I have used the x=x[1]+1; in a couple of custom studies and have x[1]+1 starting at 2 for one study, x[1]+1 starting at 13 for another. Does ThinkScript do some sort of auto-lookback period determination that determines the value of x[1] for each study?
15:41 Mobius: If you want to index x then use compoundValue
compoundValue(1, x[1] + 1, 1)
where the first variable is the bar to start the second is the variable to perform and the third variable is the initial value
15:45 Biometrizilla: Does that mean that the code on the Web site for Inertia is incorrect?
15:45 Biometrizilla: script inertiaTS {
    input y = close;
    input n = 20;
    def x = x[1] + 1;
    def a = (n * Sum(x * y, n) - Sum(x, n) * Sum(y, n) ) / ( n * Sum(Sqr(x), n) - Sqr(Sum(x, n)));
    def b = (Sum(Sqr(x), n) * Sum(y, n) - Sum(x, n) * Sum(x * y, n) ) / ( n * Sum(Sqr(x), n) - Sqr(Sum(x, n)));
    plot InertiaTS = a * x + b;
input length = 20;
plot LinReg1 = Inertia(close, length);
plot LinReg2 = InertiaTS(close, length);
15:45 Mobius: no  it means your use was.  That code works as designed
15:45 AlphaInvestor: Biom - don't Dis der Mobius scripts
15:46 Mobius: I have checked every study and function in TOS - There is only one that doesn't work as purposed   declare once_per_bar
15:48 Biometrizilla: Not dissing, trying to understand. I know that the study works. How is the usage different? I took the code I just posted and put it in a new study. If I plot x it starts at 13 on the first bar. Why does it do that?
15:49 Mobius: My crystal ball is broken. You'll have to post the entire code for me to give a reason
15:50 Mobius: Or you can use AddLabel or plot .Values_Below to deBug your code
15:51 Mobius: There's always a reason. And; 99.99999% of the time it's PEBCAK error
15:52 Mobius: That holds for me too. Not picking on anyone
15:52 thomas7156: Thanks Mobius  I need to do some reading and study on thinkscript coding syntax etc.. I haven't done any coding in the last 30 years and that was basic and early C+. I chanded the top 2 line to input try to get dome feed back from TOS and I posted the chqnged code I changed the inputs back to def and the scan runs bu does not finish or display anything. Further study for sure won't hurt me. I have been retired for 4 years and I have some time to devote to it.  Thanks so much for your help I really apreciate it. I use your and really like your True Momentum Oscillator that someone sent me. Thanks Again I'' be back
15:54 Mobius: thomas  - For some scans it's easier write the scan as a STUDY frist to make sure it's plotting as you want then reference that plot. I find that easiest
16:00 Biometrizilla: Code coming up. I took the inertiaTS off the website, declared it a lower study and put in a plot statement in the script. In this case the x value for the first bar seems to match the length value.
16:00 Biometrizilla: declare lower;
script inertiaTS {
    plot xplot = x;
16:00 Biometrizilla: It has to be operator error but I need to figure out what I'm doing to cause it.
16:04 amalia: Refer to post @hh:50
16:04 Biometrizilla: Then if I take the same code, don't use the script approach and use different equations for calculating slope and intercept, the output matches and this time x for first bar is 13.
16:04 Biometrizilla: declare lower;
input length = 89;
# Incrementing x for each bar moves endpoint each bar
# This duplicates the TOS LinearRegCurve function, which calls Inertia
def x = x[1]+1;
plot XPlot = x;
# Slope & Intercept calculations
def Ex = Sum(x,length);
def Ey = Sum(price,length);
def Exy = Sum(x*price,length);
def Ex2 = Sum(x*x,length);
def Denominator = (length*Ex2) - sqr(Ex);
def Slope = ((length*Exy) - (Ex*Ey)) / Denominator;
def Intercept = ((Ex2*Ey) - (Ex*Exy))/ Denominator;
plot LinearRegCurve = (Slope * x) + Intercept;
LinearRegCurve.setdefaultColor(color.Red);
# Check against TOS built-in Inertia function
plot InertiaTS = Inertia(price,length);
InertiaTS.setdefaultColor(color.Yellow);
16:08 Up_n_Up: don't know if this applies in this case, but in any case you probably should find 'prefetch
16:08 Up_n_Up: in the manual/tutorials and understand the potential impacts
16:10 Up_n_Up: CompoundValue, as was pointed out,, is a more definitive of initializing a variable,
16:10 Up_n_Up: *method* of
16:11 AlphaInvestor: Yeah ... where does it get that first X -  I am sure Biom is assuming the first X is zero ... but why is he assuming that?
16:12 AlphaInvestor: def X = if barnumber() == 1 then 1 else x[1] + 1;      # might work better
16:12 MTS1: Debug the code as suggested already to find out. .
16:13 Biometrizilla: Up_n_Up - that's what I was refering to in my initial question. Prefetch determines an auto-lookback period based on what is going on in the study. I'll investigate this some more. Thanks for pointing me in that direction.
16:14 Biometrizilla: AlphaInvestor - I believe in reading through the material that when discussing recursion it was stated that when you define a variable it starts at zero. But that may not be the case if Prefetching comes into play.
16:14 Mobius: Prefetch isn't used except for infinite impulse ThinkScript Native Studies.
16:14 MTS1: Nope; based on the MA period and type only Bio
16:15 Mobius: You can not call or access prefetch
16:15 Mobius: from thinkScript or any thinkScript function. Only the native studies call it
16:15 MTS1: That's why compoundvalue was suggested.
16:16 Biometrizilla: Past offset is what looks like is the appropriate item. It's on the same page as Prefetch.
16:16 Mobius: native studies and native functions such as
ExpAverage()
Average()
WildersAverage()
16:17 MTS1: Past Offset does not impact 'visible data' which is only data TS has access to.
16:17 Mobius: Although Average isn't an infinite impulse tos does use prefetch so that it plots at the first bar
16:17 bigworm: native blankets
16:18 Mobius: Alrighty then. Time to find something interesting to drink.
16:18 bigworm: jack and coke?
16:18 bigworm: that used to get me into trouble
16:19 Biometrizilla: So I posted the cut and paste from the Inertia definition. Would you expect that x at the first bar would be zero?
16:19 Mobius: I'd never ruin a perfectly good whisky with coke. Yuk
16:19 bigworm: are you saying jack daniels is a good whiskey?
16:20 Mobius: Bio.. I expect nothing I check.  Use SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.Values_Below) and find out
16:20 bigworm: ive been told makers mark is pretty good.  also, they have a cool bottle.
16:21 Mobius: JD is whisky.  Single Barrel is Good and some others are great
16:21 AlphaInvestor: Biom - I would expect it to be some random number pulled out of the air ... because you didn't initialize it
16:22 AlphaInvestor: It MAY work sometimes, but in every case it is Bad Form
16:26 Biometrizilla: Ok. I'll play around with CompoundValue. Plenty of examples in the online information that shows def x = x[1] + 1; as a valid way to do things.
16:27 Mobius: Bio..
def x = x[1] + 1;
def y = compoundValue(1, y[1] + 1, 0);
plot data1 = x;
data1.SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.Values_Below);
plot data2 = y;
data2.SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.Values_Above);
16:33 MTS1: And Bio; remember that we here have no input or control on the manual; just volunteers interested in TS that try to help. The manual is certainly a place to start learn TS or find functions, but when you get answers here and suggestions (and how to) debug to verify what's happening, it is of no value to argue, repeat code examples without debugging, or quote the manual back. .
16:36 AlphaInvestor: Biom - add this as well. You will see that my method, which initializes the first bar using a RECursive variable, also works
def z = if barnumber() == 1 then 0 else z[1]+1;
plot data3 = z;
data3.SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.Values_Below);
16:36 MTS1: (quote the manual back questioning the answers without verifying yourself I meant)
16:43 Mobius: Valid for a use. Like a hammer is valid for a use. But painting a house isn't one of those uses. Sure you could do it but it'd be a lot easier to use a different tool
16:45 Mobius: In Incrementing a variable it may or may not be important to start at 1 or 0.
16:47 Nube: As an example, when I was a lad I washed my mother's car with a rock. A rock is a perfectly good tool, not so much for cleaning mumsie's Cordoba however.
16:48 Nube: "I love what you've done to my Cordoba" was not her response
16:48 Mobius: ha
16:49 Mobius: I did the same sort of thing when Brillo Pads first came out
16:49 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - how did the boat fare after Michael?
16:50 Mobius: No problems. Alpha...  Not anything the bilge pump even had a hard time with  :)
16:52 bigworm: sometimes I acutally laugh out loud at whats said in this room
16:53 bigworm: not just a fake lol but furealz
16:53 Mobius: I've done that with a mouth full of coffee.. Not good for the keyboard.
17:01 AlphaInvestor: I keep wipes handy to clean off my monitor for such occurances
17:57 dtree: hello gurus
17:57 dtree: need help on configuring scans
17:59 dtree: how can I get alert with stocks that have 3 consecutive 1 minute green candels?
18:01 Up_n_Up: how are you defining green?
18:01 dtree: green close - close > open ? I dont know - guessing
18:02 Up_n_Up: so close higher than open?
18:02 dtree: in that minute yes
18:02 Up_n_Up: sum(close>open,3)==3
18:03 Up_n_Up: that be it.
18:03 Up_n_Up: later folks...
18:04 dtree: do you have a library of scripts I can read
18:05 momo: dtree make sure you select 1 minute aggregation in scan script with that code
18:06 momo: Default is usually D for daily, change that to 1 minute
18:06 dtree: I am compeletely new for this guys - I worked on C# and TSQL
18:07 dtree: basically what i want is - priceline is above VWAP , 20SMA, 50SMA, 200 SMA
18:07 dtree: and when 3 green candlestickes occure I want to get alert
18:08 dtree: please help
18:10 momo: close > VWAP() and close > average(close,20) and close > average(close,50) and close > average(close,200) and sum(close > open,3) == 3
18:11 momo: select 1 minute aggregation in script
18:12 momo: Then you can save scan as watchlist and also create alert on scan
18:13 dtree: would it be possible for you to send me this custome scan? I want to learn from it also , as its going to be the first script for me
18:14 momo: I already wrote it above, copy paste in custom scan
18:15 momo: Call support to guide you through how to use scan feature and they will guide you one on one
18:16 momo: 866-839-1100
