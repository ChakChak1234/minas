14:32 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I like a tax cut, but think Trump can do better.  I like the national sales tax.....with a cap.    Then EVERYBODY pays.   No loopholes for 1%ers, not that i have anything against people getting rich.
14:32 VolCrush: but its a course change, which means they broke

14:38 TnT: not allowed to use the word safety and bitcoin in same sentence
14:38 radon224: that's like looking for safety by hiding behind the chain saws
14:38 TnT: ^^^^^^^^^^^^

14:44 mep1976: if assigend 6.82 avg iv high
14:44 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I feel like shorting GS before it possibly breaks a neckline.
14:45 VolCrush: FINS sucked today
14:45 VolCrush: part of the rotation
14:46 TnT: 17 days to FOMC announcement
14:46 TnT: 15 days to election
14:46 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I  see a huge head and shoulders on the weekly.  not sure if its valid though. GS

14:50 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I'm not going long anything until i see confirmation.
14:52 VolCrush: thats what i told my wife on our wedding night
14:53 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: :)
14:53 VolCrush: : )
14:53 TnT: wow,  sunset 6:30, that is an outrage, I want my daylight back
14:54 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: "der fruit" weakened too with shooting star.
14:54 chenmann: gonna get out on this littlr  bounce
14:54 chenmann: little
14:55 VolCrush: yah, vary weak close
14:55 ScottishClaymore1: Largo Resources (LGORF)& Vanadium. The future is Vanadium Redox Batteries for the Power Grid Storage. Way better than Lithium. Vanadium has boat loads of other uses as well. China is buying it by the arm loads.
14:56 VolCrush: i stopped reading on the word China
14:56 TnT: oh boy, a penny pusher
14:57 VolCrush: frankly these pussies that come in pumping there pennies is just humor
14:57 VolCrush: *their
14:57 chenmann: out .35, .35 loss
14:57 chenmann: at least we know where the sellers live....
14:58 AlphaInvestor: oh oh, somebody set a booby trap Pump & Dump Claymore
14:59 VolCrush: bronx u around
15:00 21sa: Spy closing below 200 ma not a good sign
15:00 fred__w: ok  its official  nothing happened today
15:00 VolCrush: haha
15:00 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: took no action except for SBUX short which i got out of with small small loss,  thinking i should've went in short at close.
15:01 ScottishClaymore1: Seriously look it up & tell me I am wrong after you do your homework. Better than over saturated pot stocks. Who knows which ones survive in that muck.
15:01 VolCrush: not a gud close to be sure

shift to futters trading ON
15:02 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: scott, be careful with those penny stocks.  
15:03 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: shooting star 25 minutes ago was good sell signal.  I woulda coulda shoulda went short then  :(
15:03 ScottishClaymore1: I am. I have my stops in.
15:04 mep1976: trades on otc ewwww
15:04 AlphaInvestor: AMTD beat E, beat R
15:05 AlphaInvestor: its actually profitable, wow
15:05 TnT: Vanadium batteries have been around a long long time, they are huge for capacity, very low energy density, can't possibly compete with Lithium batteries
15:05 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: trying to spot the next apple in those pennie is "fruit"less.  
15:05 ScottishClaymore1: Honestly look into Vanadium in general. I like Largo but that is my pick. Not many to choose from in that area.
15:05 TnT: berg
15:06 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Metals are looking better for sure.
15:06 fred__w: one curious tidbit is my etf pair is unslipping  has been for a while now
15:06 ScottishClaymore1: Again. Doesn't hurt to take a peek.
15:06 TnT: we do not need penny pushers in here
15:07 TnT: /PA was a big winner today, up 3.69%
15:07 ScottishClaymore1: I am usually not a penny pusher. Rode FCX up from just over $5 to 17
15:07 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: when you get those flyers in the mail, just toss em.  they are pump and dump schemes.
15:07 ScottishClaymore1: Also NOG from 1.72 to now
15:08 TnT: /ES 1.6 m
15:10 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: eggNOG with rum i definitely like  :)
15:10 TnT: skip the eggnog
15:11 fred__w: ..i usually skip the rum
15:12 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: bad close, but still held on to morning gains.
15:12 TnT: everyone have a good evening, see ya in the morning
15:12 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: u 2
15:15 fred__w: time for my daily wrapup  chao
15:44 mep1976: bitcoin creeping as more people seek safety
15:56 RandomDan: Seeking safety with bitcoin is like holding on to a piano on the Titanic.
15:59 chenmannmobile: it s manipulated, there s bid under 6k
15:59 chenmannmobile: like nio, a bid under 7....but disappointing action today
16:00 chenmannmobile: nio
16:00 RandomDan: it was fine. I got to sell my puts.
16:01 RandomDan: selling gets thin under 7 because there is noone left for whom selling at that price is not a loss.
16:01 RandomDan: the IPO was at 6.36 IIRC
16:03 chenmannmobile: but expected more of a up move on china over night and a target of $12
16:03 chenmannmobile: credit sussie
16:04 chenmannmobile: suisse
16:16 AlphaInvestor: I would expect an up move ...when they actually start making cars
Last quarter NIO sold $7.22 million worth of cars, that cost them $31.27 million to build ... (not including Depreciation & Amoritization of $22.71 million)
16:21 mep1976: Yea go nio!
16:21 mep1976: Lol
16:50 AlphaInvestor: I know Dan doesn't like to hear it, but dem der facts
17:48 RandomDan: Al, I have no problem hearing that NIO doesn't have scale now. That's why it's worth $7 and not $70. This is a long-term position and I am totally comfortable with it.
17:49 tmoney20g: dan, you're so random
17:49 RandomDan: I try to be.
18:01 CBDHemp: Hi
18:05 RandomDan: Hi Hemp
18:06 tmoney20g: @esmal, do anything today ?
18:07 tmoney20g: i was having bday cake when that little bump hit at 1030
18:07 tmoney20g: i tried a call after that first pullback but it didn't go anywhere, so i got back out of it
18:08 tmoney20g: from like 1107 to 1152
18:08 Ollie: Rail companies?
18:57 chenmannmobile: es gap down half an hour age, not good, lets c if theres another down move coming here....
18:57 chenmannmobile: ago
19:00 FunPilot: Hello All
19:01 bigworm: what time does afrter hours close?
19:01 FunPilot: I believe it is 1959 EST.
19:02 bigworm: i think i want to gamble
19:02 bigworm: buy some RGLS right now
19:03 FunPilot: RGLS
19:03 bigworm: yeah
19:04 FunPilot: That is a painful chart and numbers.
19:04 bigworm: wahts painful about it
19:04 bigworm: look after hours
19:05 bigworm: I find it odd financials are are not doing well yet rates will be going up and are going up
19:05 bigworm: we are late cycle
19:05 FunPilot: I just wonder what is driving it.
19:06 bigworm: look at fed balance sheet
19:06 bigworm: and look at rates
19:07 bigworm: at the same time fed gov is issuing more debt
19:07 chenmannmobile: yep there s that down move
19:07 bigworm: uh huh
19:07 bigworm: breaks that 2740 bye bye bye
19:08 FunPilot: The news talks about reporting on the RGLS4326 treatment, but doesn't mention what the expectations are.
19:08 bigworm: yeah idk
19:08 bigworm: i just see it moving
19:09 bigworm: i hope the vix pops hard again
19:10 FunPilot: I've been burned so many times by Penny Stocks and Pink Sheets that I tend to stay away from those.  In Theory, you could win big, or lose big.  But maybe $4K is worth the rist.
19:10 FunPilot: risk.
19:10 bigworm: yeah i dont do penny stocks
19:10 bigworm: i was just saying i wanted to gamble
19:10 bigworm: but i dont actually do it
19:10 bigworm: i made good money beginning of the year when vix popped
19:10 bigworm: i shorted
19:11 FunPilot: Do a paper trade and see what happens.
19:11 FunPilot: I haven't done any shorts.  All my accounts are IRAs.
19:11 bigworm: lol naw paper trade is for strategy testing.  what if I made money on that paper trade?  what would that tell me? basically nothing.
19:12 FunPilot: LOL, that you guessed right on this 50/50 shot.
19:12 bigworm: yeah
19:12 bigworm: who cares about that
19:12 bigworm: but it looks like it could continue higher
19:12 FunPilot: Se La Vie
19:12 bigworm: maybe ill check on the open
19:12 bigworm: damn look at es
19:12 FunPilot: Yeah, I'm looking at BP.
19:13 bigworm: british petroleum
19:14 FunPilot: Yeah, really good dividend and I think oil is going to stop the downward turn.  But I digress.
19:14 bigworm: MRO looks good
19:15 chenmannmobile: wow breaking down
19:15 FunPilot: Yeah, for sure.
19:18 RandomDan: index futs looking kinda rough
19:18 bigworm: I bet it bounces on 2700 next few days
19:18 RandomDan: but... I've seen this before where ny tye next day it turns out to be nothing
19:18 RandomDan: by the
19:19 FunPilot: Random, iteresting

19:23 ameriman: doom
19:23 chenmannmobile: haha ameri
19:23 chenmannmobile: but ya dom
19:23 chenmannmobile: doom
19:25 FunPilot: I found it interesting that Netflix went up with just bigger subscriber numbers.  The other numbers were good, but not great.
19:28 bigworm: yup up and then quickly down
19:30 RandomDan: it did
19:32 FunPilot: Yes but how much of that is because market momentum?
19:33 bigworm: idk
