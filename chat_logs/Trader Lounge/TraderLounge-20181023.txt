14:32 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I like a tax cut, but think Trump can do better.  I like the national sales tax.....with a cap.    Then EVERYBODY pays.   No loopholes for 1%ers, not that i have anything against people getting rich.
14:32 VolCrush: but its a course change, which means they broke
14:32 radon224: I like to trade derivitaves on highly illiquid products with little/no price transparancy.  But that's just me.

14:38 TnT: not allowed to use the word safety and bitcoin in same sentence
14:38 radon224: that's like looking for safety by hiding behind the chain saws
14:38 TnT: ^^^^^^^^^^^^

14:44 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I feel like shorting GS before it possibly breaks a neckline.
14:45 VolCrush: FINS sucked today
14:45 VolCrush: part of the rotation
14:46 TnT: 17 days to FOMC announcement

14:52 VolCrush: thats what i told my wife on our wedding night
14:53 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: :)
14:53 VolCrush: : )
14:53 TnT: wow,  sunset 6:30, that is an outrage, I want my daylight back
14:54 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: "der fruit" weakened too with shooting star.
14:54 chenmann: gonna get out on this littlr  bounce
14:54 chenmann: little
14:55 VolCrush: yah, vary weak close
14:55 ScottishClaymore1: Largo Resources (LGORF)& Vanadium. The future is Vanadium Redox Batteries for the Power Grid Storage. Way better than Lithium. Vanadium has boat loads of other uses as well. China is buying it by the arm loads.
14:56 VolCrush: i stopped reading on the word China
14:56 TnT: oh boy, a penny pusher
14:57 VolCrush: frankly these pussies that come in pumping there pennies is just humor
14:57 VolCrush: *their
14:57 chenmann: out .35, .35 loss
14:57 chenmann: at least we know where the sellers live....
14:58 AlphaInvestor: oh oh, somebody set a booby trap Pump & Dump Claymore
14:59 VolCrush: bronx u around
15:00 21sa: Spy closing below 200 ma not a good sign
15:00 fred__w: ok  its official  nothing happened today
15:00 VolCrush: haha
15:00 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: took no action except for SBUX short which i got out of with small small loss,  thinking i should've went in short at close.
15:01 ScottishClaymore1: Seriously look it up & tell me I am wrong after you do your homework. Better than over saturated pot stocks. Who knows which ones survive in that muck.
15:01 VolCrush: not a gud close to be sure

shift to futters trading ON
15:02 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: scott, be careful with those penny stocks.  
15:03 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: shooting star 25 minutes ago was good sell signal.  I woulda coulda shoulda went short then  :(
15:03 ScottishClaymore1: I am. I have my stops in.
15:04 mep1976: trades on otc ewwww
15:04 AlphaInvestor: AMTD beat E, beat R
15:05 AlphaInvestor: its actually profitable, wow
15:05 TnT: Vanadium batteries have been around a long long time, they are huge for capacity, very low energy density, can't possibly compete with Lithium batteries
15:05 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: trying to spot the next apple in those pennie is "fruit"less.  
15:05 ScottishClaymore1: Honestly look into Vanadium in general. I like Largo but that is my pick. Not many to choose from in that area.
15:05 TnT: berg
15:06 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Metals are looking better for sure.
15:06 fred__w: one curious tidbit is my etf pair is unslipping  has been for a while now
15:06 ScottishClaymore1: Again. Doesn't hurt to take a peek.
15:06 TnT: we do not need penny pushers in here
15:07 TnT: /PA was a big winner today, up 3.69%
15:07 ScottishClaymore1: I am usually not a penny pusher. Rode FCX up from just over $5 to 17
15:07 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: when you get those flyers in the mail, just toss em.  they are pump and dump schemes.
15:07 ScottishClaymore1: Also NOG from 1.72 to now
15:08 TnT: /ES 1.6 m
15:10 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: eggNOG with rum i definitely like  :)
15:10 TnT: skip the eggnog
15:11 fred__w: ..i usually skip the rum
15:12 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: bad close, but still held on to morning gains.
15:12 TnT: everyone have a good evening, see ya in the morning
15:12 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: u 2
15:15 fred__w: time for my daily wrapup  chao
15:44 mep1976: bitcoin creeping as more people seek safety
15:56 RandomDan: Seeking safety with bitcoin is like holding on to a piano on the Titanic.
15:59 chenmannmobile: it s manipulated, there s bid under 6k
15:59 chenmannmobile: like nio, a bid under 7....but disappointing action today
16:00 chenmannmobile: nio
16:00 RandomDan: it was fine. I got to sell my puts.
16:01 RandomDan: selling gets thin under 7 because there is noone left for whom selling at that price is not a loss.
16:01 RandomDan: the IPO was at 6.36 IIRC
16:03 chenmannmobile: but expected more of a up move on china over night and a target of $12
16:03 chenmannmobile: credit sussie
16:04 chenmannmobile: suisse
16:16 AlphaInvestor: I would expect an up move ...when they actually start making cars
Last quarter NIO sold $7.22 million worth of cars, that cost them $31.27 million to build ... (not including Depreciation & Amoritization of $22.71 million)
16:21 mep1976: Yea go nio!
16:21 mep1976: Lol
16:50 AlphaInvestor: I know Dan doesn't like to hear it, but dem der facts
17:48 RandomDan: Al, I have no problem hearing that NIO doesn't have scale now. That's why it's worth $7 and not $70. This is a long-term position and I am totally comfortable with it.
17:49 tmoney20g: dan, you're so random
17:49 RandomDan: I try to be.
18:01 CBDHemp: Hi
18:05 RandomDan: Hi Hemp
18:06 tmoney20g: @esmal, do anything today ?
18:07 tmoney20g: i was having bday cake when that little bump hit at 1030
18:07 tmoney20g: i tried a call after that first pullback but it didn't go anywhere, so i got back out of it
18:08 tmoney20g: from like 1107 to 1152
18:08 Ollie: Rail companies?
18:57 chenmannmobile: es gap down half an hour age, not good, lets c if theres another down move coming here....
18:57 chenmannmobile: ago
19:00 FunPilot: Hello All
19:01 bigworm: what time does afrter hours close?
19:01 FunPilot: I believe it is 1959 EST.
19:02 bigworm: i think i want to gamble
19:02 bigworm: buy some RGLS right now
19:03 FunPilot: RGLS
19:03 bigworm: yeah
19:04 FunPilot: That is a painful chart and numbers.
19:04 bigworm: wahts painful about it
19:04 bigworm: look after hours
19:05 bigworm: I find it odd financials are are not doing well yet rates will be going up and are going up
19:05 bigworm: we are late cycle
19:05 FunPilot: I just wonder what is driving it.
19:06 bigworm: look at fed balance sheet
19:06 bigworm: and look at rates
19:07 bigworm: at the same time fed gov is issuing more debt
19:07 chenmannmobile: yep there s that down move
19:07 bigworm: uh huh
19:07 bigworm: breaks that 2740 bye bye bye
19:08 FunPilot: The news talks about reporting on the RGLS4326 treatment, but doesn't mention what the expectations are.
19:08 bigworm: yeah idk
19:08 bigworm: i just see it moving
19:09 bigworm: i hope the vix pops hard again
19:10 FunPilot: I've been burned so many times by Penny Stocks and Pink Sheets that I tend to stay away from those.  In Theory, you could win big, or lose big.  But maybe $4K is worth the rist.
19:10 FunPilot: risk.
19:10 bigworm: yeah i dont do penny stocks
19:10 bigworm: i was just saying i wanted to gamble
19:10 bigworm: but i dont actually do it
19:10 bigworm: i made good money beginning of the year when vix popped
19:10 bigworm: i shorted
19:11 FunPilot: Do a paper trade and see what happens.
19:11 FunPilot: I haven't done any shorts.  All my accounts are IRAs.
19:11 bigworm: lol naw paper trade is for strategy testing.  what if I made money on that paper trade?  what would that tell me? basically nothing.
19:12 FunPilot: LOL, that you guessed right on this 50/50 shot.
19:12 bigworm: yeah
19:12 bigworm: who cares about that
19:12 bigworm: but it looks like it could continue higher
19:12 FunPilot: Se La Vie
19:12 bigworm: maybe ill check on the open
19:12 bigworm: damn look at es
19:12 FunPilot: Yeah, I'm looking at BP.
19:13 bigworm: british petroleum
19:14 FunPilot: Yeah, really good dividend and I think oil is going to stop the downward turn.  But I digress.
19:14 bigworm: MRO looks good
19:15 chenmannmobile: wow breaking down
19:15 FunPilot: Yeah, for sure.
19:18 RandomDan: index futs looking kinda rough
19:18 bigworm: I bet it bounces on 2700 next few days
19:18 RandomDan: but... I've seen this before where ny tye next day it turns out to be nothing
19:18 RandomDan: by the
19:19 FunPilot: Random, iteresting

19:23 ameriman: doom
19:23 chenmannmobile: haha ameri
19:23 chenmannmobile: but ya dom
19:23 chenmannmobile: doom
19:25 FunPilot: I found it interesting that Netflix went up with just bigger subscriber numbers.  The other numbers were good, but not great.
19:28 bigworm: yup up and then quickly down
19:30 RandomDan: it did
19:32 FunPilot: Yes but how much of that is because market momentum?
19:33 bigworm: idk

08:05 TnT: key, how about looking at the charts, they are both trading
08:07 radon224: During times like these I recommend trading dubious and highly-illiquid VIX derivative products.  Just FYI.
08:07 kev: I understand they are both trading. I’m just trying to understand if one should be focused on more than another?
08:07 TnT: radon, /VX is wtg, margin is only $13,200

08:11 AlphaInvestor: 
08:11 streetglide: why is it that /vx isn't closer in price to vix?
08:12 AlphaInvestor: It will be, at contract expiration
08:12 streetglide: isn't /vx a future on the vix?
08:12 radon224: no
08:12 radon224: or yes
08:12 mep1976: DOOM
08:12 radon224: but there are lots of article explaining the diff between /vx and spot vix
08:12 radon224: with fancy words like contango and backwardation
08:13 AlphaInvestor: Oooooh

08:27 VolCrush: art of the deal
08:27 TnT: caravan is paid for to influence our election

08:28 JabbaTheCabin: everthing gapping down.  nasdaq is gapping lower, s&p and dow about the same, russell not so much
08:28 Dimka: Watch it: dow will close up over 200. Really

08:32 DavidDT: dontblong
08:32 TnT: stating facts, did not say good or bad
08:33 JabbaTheCabin: fair enough
08:33 efu: wow this one real
08:33 VolCrush: reminds me of Thag
08:34 JabbaTheCabin: personally i want to see all the indices sell off, AAPL sell of and TSLA catch a bid.
08:34 tanker: what the heck is goin on,,  this is a bunch of ,,,,,,
08:35 AlphaInvestor: Ding - rolled deep itm mu pcs - 50 cents wider, 42 cent credit
08:35 JabbaTheCabin: i'm short TSLA puts and short AAPL calls. Both have taken a beating lately
08:35 tmoney20g: nice Al
08:36 tanker: cramers got all the answers
08:36 esmal: Good morning all
08:36 tmoney20g: esmal
08:36 tmoney20g: hi
08:36 TnT: cramer, lol
08:36 tanker: i mute him all the time
08:37 tmoney20g: i just have him for audio fill
08:37 JabbaTheCabin: cramers a joke. and not a funny one.
08:37 invertedhammer: Cramer from Seinfeld maybe
08:37 tanker: hard to belive he's still on the air,  he must have on heck of a contract
08:38 Dimka: Al, please do something re SPPI, lol
08:38 streetglide: cramer is good entertainment
08:39 TnT: /RB down over 4 cents, fill er up
08:40 Jack: Anyone know what&aposs up with WEYL ?
08:40 JabbaTheCabin: wow TSLA is really catching a bid despite the selling
08:40 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: morning all.....well when every pundit on cnbc is bullish, market had to keep going lower.   If they were all bearish, it would signal a bottom!
08:40 Dimka: Telling you: dow up over 200 at close, I am almost sure and ready to bet my ice cream on that
08:41 tmoney20g: what flavor
08:41 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: cramer is talking it up....... no bears to be  found.
08:42 JabbaTheCabin: i would watch CNBC all day long if those "experts" were trading their own money and talking about it real time.
08:42 ameriman: Plunge protection team trying not to let it go below 2700 and 7000
08:44 Dimka: Tmoney: chocolate with bacon and green peas
08:44 JabbaTheCabin: does the "plunge protection team" actually exist or they a fantasy, like Capt America?
08:44 AlphaInvestor: Ding - rolled ANET pcs
08:45 tmoney20g: there's a big red button they can hit at the nyse
08:45 tmoney20g: it just shuts the lower half of manhatten off
08:45 JabbaTheCabin: you roll defined risk spreads?
08:45 JabbaTheCabin: alpha
08:45 AlphaInvestor: Taking advantage of volatile prices to get some early rolls
08:45 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: remember a while back when we had corrections and all the gloom and doomers were still coming out of the woodwork, and the market bounced on every dip?   They are nowhere to be found now.
08:45 ameriman: Autumn rolls as supposed to spring roll
08:46 AlphaInvestor: Jabba - yes, for more credit
08:46 tmoney20g: mmm
08:46 ameriman: Opposed to
08:46 tmoney20g: "market sell-off"
08:46 tmoney20g: lol
08:46 JabbaTheCabin: ok. I usually let define risk spreads be, but will roll naked positions
08:47 mep1976: dimka BDSI green up a penny lol
08:47 AlphaInvestor: If you can do it for a credit, why not
08:47 tmoney20g: zactly
08:47 tmoney20g: make money while you make money with other people's money
08:48 JabbaTheCabin: i'm ok with rolling the short strike,  but you tend to have to pay money to roll the long strike. If the spread is profitable, i rather take it off and put on something else.
08:49 JabbaTheCabin: i don't roll IC either
08:50 JabbaTheCabin: but will roll strangles or straddles
08:50 JabbaTheCabin: if need be
08:51 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: if keeps selling off, lotta people gonna be rolling something!
08:53 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: lotta indecision going on
08:53 JabbaTheCabin: if it keeps selling off, rolling long strikes gets more expensive as IV goes up.
08:53 timothyh4jesus: any great ideas?
08:53 JabbaTheCabin: lots, but this is a family oriented board.
08:54 fred__w: tim  yes  go with it
08:54 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: with a steep downturning 200 day, SBUX keeps hanging on.
08:55 tmoney20g: @esmal, what you have your eye on
08:56 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I use a 10 week, and 40 week averages on weekly charts.  Steep downturn on SBUX 40 week...still.
08:57 JabbaTheCabin: http://tos.mx/Zx4xWr#
The weekly nasdaq chart loks interesting. It is right at support now.
08:58 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: if we had a lot of bears Jabba, it seems feasible
08:58 AlphaInvestor: Jabba - I could roll just the short put, then put back on a long put to turn it back into a spread. Then I am left with a long put in this expiration that still has value - so I sell it.
08:58 Dimka: I stand by my thoughts for close
08:58 AlphaInvestor: That is rolling a pcs
08:59 AlphaInvestor: Never roll for a debit!
08:59 AlphaInvestor: I think green close too
09:00 AlphaInvestor: Capitulation, followed by a rally into close
09:00 JabbaTheCabin: i agree there. never roll for a debit. That's  throwing good mmoney after bad
09:00 AlphaInvestor: Jabba +1
09:00 radon224: Fine Dining, Electric Cars, and Phones....MCD, TSLA, VZ.  The place to be today.
09:01 JabbaTheCabin: and i never roll when making  money. I just take profit. Rolls are for those "dammit. let's hope i can turn it around with some duration"
09:02 radon224: The guy with the beret who used to own TOS was famous for that.
09:02 blondetrader: 07/04 es
09:03 JabbaTheCabin: i lean a lpt frp, that guy
09:03 JabbaTheCabin: learn
09:03 AlphaInvestor: Rolls are for collecting more premium, plain and simple
09:04 JabbaTheCabin: correct
09:04 fred__w: boundary 13 in the books
09:05 JabbaTheCabin: i've been rolling the TSLA puts. Musk's idiotic tweets cost me/
09:05 AlphaInvestor: I roll to the expiration that gives the best profit per day (adjusted for commish and risk)
09:07 JabbaTheCabin: do  you do weeklies? I stay with monthlies 
09:08 AlphaInvestor: Weeklys, Monthlys - doesn't matter to me
09:09 AlphaInvestor: I am often all the OI - because I am totally okay with being put stock
09:09 JabbaTheCabin: weekles tend to be less liquid. wider spread
09:10 JabbaTheCabin: if you have the capital for it, and you think that longer term static delta will work your way, then being put stock is fine
09:11 JabbaTheCabin: then just sell a call against it
09:11 radon224: I only sell puts on stocks that I want to own at the put strike.  The premium if unassigned is the "consolation prize" for me.
09:11 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: one more bull on cnbc now.
09:12 JabbaTheCabin: they should put on a cow for a change
09:12 tmoney20g: mooooooooooooo
09:14 blondetrader: would be nice if we can get to tgts by tomorrow
09:14 blondetrader: or today :)
09:14 JabbaTheCabin: i sell puts all the t ime, and calls. if IVR is high. I try not to get put stock or get called away, though
09:14 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: where da bears?  grrrrrrrrrr....
09:15 streetglide: where is that bt on the es/spx?
09:15 blondetrader: es ultimate 65

09:15 blondetrader: 6790 nq
09:15 blondetrader: 1485 rty
09:15 JabbaTheCabin: nasdaq at the weekly support.  it was 80 points away when i posted the chart earlier this morning. wow.
09:16 fred__w: boundary 14 gone
09:16 streetglide: eww..2 666

09:17 TnT: /es over 1 m
09:17 fred__w: ..and boundary 15
09:17 JabbaTheCabin: wow. it was >500K premarket.
09:18 chenmann: big ass sell program just now when es broke 2698
09:18 JabbaTheCabin: one of the highst volume days in a long time.
09:18 streetglide: think we might bounce at 2688 ish....
09:19 radon224: ya, I think I saw 2 500-lot /es order pop off on the bid
09:19 DrHouse: TSLA has been my best position for the day... everything else, not so hot
09:19 streetglide: but could be a hollow cat which wont bounce very high
09:19 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: welcome to the new bear market
09:19 DrHouse: I feel welcomed already
09:19 radon224: It seems like a hollow cat would bounce more than one full of guts....just imo.
09:20 JabbaTheCabin: all the indexes  down over 2% with nasdaq pushing for 3
09:20 DrHouse: Ya ain’t gonna mummify a cat
09:20 blondetrader: 2707 res es
09:20 invertedhammer: Long rty 03
09:20 blondetrader: 85 next tg lower
09:21 JabbaTheCabin: getting a little short covering. profit taking?
09:22 efu: no fear yet tho
09:23 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: big flight to safety in 20yr treasuries
09:23 esmal: @Tmoney, nothing, imma probably not really do too much this week, bout to get my severance package at work and im too excited right now
09:23 chenmann: cash is KING
09:23 JabbaTheCabin: with VIX up 20% and 1 million s&p contracts traded, there is a fair amount of fear.
09:23 efu: NQ goes down 300 + then fear
09:24 JabbaTheCabin: chen - if I were all in cash right now, i would be kickiing myself.
09:25 tmoney20g: why
09:25 chenmann: he s short
09:25 tmoney20g: @esmal, nice.  quitting or retiring or what ?
09:26 JabbaTheCabin: being laid off?
09:26 fred__w: i am liquidating my shorts very slowly
09:27 JabbaTheCabin: now is a good time to find a job if that's what you are looking for. low unemployment, and a lot of jobs unfilled.
09:27 JabbaTheCabin: with the right skills, of course.

09:41 Eedie: Chuck not always. Usually I will short the futures...this past few days I’ve been getting out of positions because of mid term elections. I didn’t want to ride through the shenanigans
09:41 TnT: the signs have been there a long long time in advance tanya, rising rates ultimately catch up to  equity pricing
09:41 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: dow and s&p only 7.5% off highs, not even technically a ''correction'' yet.
09:41 Tanya: It is going to be ok, I sit tight and buying more here

09:44 TnT: chen, let's just say not a good idea to short the dollar with rising rates
09:44 chenmann: k

09:48 Tanya: Time to buy if more cash available, stocks are cheap
09:49 Tanya: Market may turn positive by end of day
09:49 TnT: /zb up over a full point
09:49 fred__w: chuck  drawdown mgmt is the major foe to fight during this provess

10:09 JabbaTheCabin: these days when i order stuff from AMZN, it gets deliverd by their own people. FDX and UPS may be losijng out on business

10:11 tmoney20g: they ordered what, 20k of the sprinters ?
10:11 TnT: my most recent delivery was an Amazon van, had about 3 deliveries where they were using  a Hertz rental van
10:12 AlphaInvestor: AMZN is fronting money/vans to peeps to set up biz to deliver for them
10:12 YClan: I have never seen an actual amazon truck/van delivering stuff... it's always USPS, or UPS, or FEDX or other smaller sub-contracted delivery companies.
10:12 JabbaTheCabin: i had thought about startiing up a delivery business with AMZN, but they have a way of screwing their partners.
10:13 VolCrush: my amazon stuff is dilevered to me by 6 foot tall blonde women in hi heels, i beleive they are called zonian women, theyll clean your house as well....... a 2 for delievery service

10:14 YClan: looks like the blood in the streets was just ketchup.  oh well,   /pandemonium
10:15 JabbaTheCabin: until you are stubbing your toes tripping over corpses,  there is no blood in the streets.

11:53 AlphaInvestor: what is beaver, other than the National Symbol of Canada?
11:53 mep1976: free baller haller

11:53 TnT: lol
11:53 Dimka: Al, food?

11:54 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Saudi's appear to be driving oil DOWN to hurt U.S. domestic production.....again, like several years ago.   But they broadcasted they would drive price UP bc of possible sanctions.   
11:55 TnT: price would not have gone below 30 a while back if OPEC was in control
11:55 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: OPEC not in control of anything.  Saudi's are and they know it.
11:56 TnT: not
11:56 YClan: Daryyl,    my theory is Trump told Saudi's to drop the price of oil going into the election, and he'll give them a break on that Koshoggi murder thing
11:56 streetglide: Tnt you are going to get summoned to the consulate if you keep it up
11:57 TnT: not a theory, Trump asked Saudi's to lower price multiple times, it is public knowledge
11:57 tmoney20g: and all you'll get is a lousy t-shirt
11:57 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I don't see Trump harming the domestic oil industry just to do that.
11:57 VolCrush: public knowledge?  one can trade it and not go to jail
11:57 TnT: Trump did not like prices of $75 to $80, thought they were too high
11:58 TnT: yes, Vol, he tweeted about it
11:58 TnT: and complained about it in talks and white house breifings
11:58 VolCrush: some day when i grow up i will get a twitter account
11:58 TnT: if you don't know that, you are not paying attention
11:59 TnT: Trump is only reason I watch twitter
11:59 VolCrush: huh?  ill have what she is having
11:59 AlphaInvestor: DING - closed NE short call for 2 cents
11:59 tmoney20g: nice
12:00 TnT: Trump tweets are often market movers
12:00 AlphaInvestor: I had a resting GTC order at 2 cents, wouldn't fill ... so I bumped it to 3 cents ... then it filled at 2 cents
12:01 tmoney20g: lovely lady bumps
12:01 TnT: which, is not a political statement by the way
12:01 tmoney20g: alright buyers, your time to shine

12:09 YClan: Trump seems to like name-calling the Chinese leader... keeps calling him 'she'.   OMG how embarrasing.
12:09 chenmann: haha
12:09 chenmann: he meant xi
12:09 TnT: that is how Xi is pronouced
12:09 YClan: xi = eleven ?

12:30 ILoseaLot: Hey there, I'm new to Thinkorswim. I must have clicked something that caused my stock chart to turn into cubes and numbers: 123456, etc. How do I get my normal chart back? Thanks

12:32 tmoney20g: then choose the way you want it to look
12:33 ILoseaLot: Thank you! I guess I chose Monkey Bars... Thanks!
12:33 tmoney20g: yw
12:35 stockhawk: 2730 ( the previous low on the SPX  is noow becoming the overhead resistance and subsequently a test. If we clear it with conviction, the market  will power back up with a vangeance. Let's watch carefully this 2726 SPX level.
12:36 stockhawk: looks like it's struggling to take it out.
12:38 stockhawk: I want to see power up past 2735 to restore my confidence. However still long AMBA :)
12:41 blondetrader: lucky if it doesnt retest lows
12:42 stockhawk: blondtrader> yes and if it fails then we'll retest the 2691 low.
12:43 blondetrader: I was hodling out hope for 88 :)
12:43 blondetrader: wpould make me feel better lol
12:44 stockhawk: you want to see it take out the the overhead 2735 with conviction
12:44 blondetrader: no I really dont
12:44 blondetrader: I want to see 2688 and then maybe a gap lower tomorrow to 65ish
12:44 stockhawk: lol . why ? are you short a stock
12:44 stockhawk: ?
12:45 blondetrader: then we can rally till the cows come home
12:45 featherweight: Short many stocks :)
12:45 tmoney20g: maybe today is the beginning
12:45 blondetrader: I am short futs stocks
12:45 stockhawk: i see
12:45 blondetrader: tmoney ya but overall we r close to a dly lows
12:45 stockhawk: here are the levels :
12:45 blondetrader: like next day or so
12:45 stockhawk: 2726
12:46 stockhawk: 2674
12:46 blondetrader: 2674 works for me
12:46 stockhawk: 2623
12:46 stockhawk: and finally 2572
12:46 YClan: :17 News Bot: Google (GOOGL) Android apps installed, over 100 million times, tracked user behavior and used this data to create an army of bots; which stole millions of dollars from digital advertisers, according to BuzzFeed 
12:47 blondetrader: hmmm
12:47 stockhawk: 2674 is doable if it takes out 2726 with conviction
12:48 radon224: An army of bots...clicking and clanking and making those annoying "beep, boop, bop" noises.  Glad I have an iPhone
12:48 stockhawk: market likes testing levels
12:48 stockhawk: there is geometry inmarkets and someone knows it darn well.
12:49 YClan: radon,  to me... all the money spent on on-line ads, or on the ads placed in free phone games is just a big waste of ad money.
12:50 stockhawk: google is public ennemy #1
12:50 featherweight: BT sent you a note. Probably better to pick up later this week?
12:51 blondetrader: I saw ....i will get back after close
12:53 featherweight: Ty!
12:55 matt1974: finally TSLA coming up on my vertical

13:02 tmoney20g: aww
13:02 tmoney20g: mine might start today
13:02 tmoney20g: if we can rally into the close
13:04 tmoney20g: seems like too tall of an order tho
13:04 RandomDan: I sold a TSLA put a couple of days ago, another one today. Unfortunately also sold the two calls I had way, way too early.
13:04 DrHouse: If we rally close, be great. So far, TSLA and NFLX have been my stellar ones. Futures was okay for today. Rest of them, either small losses, break even or just puny profit
13:04 Aaron: Wa
13:04 RandomDan: GS is just a disaster for me.
13:05 DrHouse: Tomorrow should be good.
13:05 DrHouse: Anticipating it.
13:05 stockhawk: blondetrader> Just for fun.... what's your take on how the market wil close ? :)
13:06 RandomDan: damage from Roku as well.
13:06 stockhawk: I usually never forecast, but my hunch tells me we''
13:06 tmoney20g: here's one thing i can't figure out
13:06 stockhawk: we'll close up between 2730 and 2740
13:06 tmoney20g: i can drag the price axis and it gets bigger/smaller
13:06 RandomDan: NVDA another dog for me.
13:07 tmoney20g: but how do you drag to shift it up/down ?
13:08 VolCrush: way to go out on a ledge @hawk
13:08 RandomDan: I don't think you can do that, except by changing some of the settings.
13:08 tmoney20g: probably what i figured
13:08 AlphaInvestor: Tmoney - hold the control key ddown and drag up/down
13:08 VolCrush: fruit bid wit 20 R

13:41 TnT: ah
13:42 AlphaInvestor: I said Capitulation early this morning and agreed with Dimka when he said green close
13:42 TnT: given the recent rate and bond action, I would say a hike on Nov 8 is baked in
13:42 chenmann: i m still sitting this one out....lol
13:42 fred__w: alpha  thats a kneejerk reaction  to a kneejerk reaction  nothing more
13:43 TnT: make in 50 bps just to stir the pot

13:44 fred__w: ..this is a downtrend on the dailies  which hasnt been challenged as yet  and a new low was set to boot
13:44 TnT: Nov meeting has a presser
13:44 AlphaInvestor: No raise in Nov ... dats jus cray cray.
Most think there will be a raise in Dec ... I say they will hold off
13:44 YClan: The next hike will be on Sunday when NFL kicks off

13:45 TnT: ok, so then why the big runup in TNX and TYX?

13:46 Dimka: I am back and market is still red???? Will raise hell now
13:46 tmoney20g: yes
13:46 TnT: I was wrong, it is Dec meeting has a presser, Nov does not, so Dec raise, sorry
13:46 tmoney20g: maybe end up +0 if you're lucky
13:46 tmoney20g: your +200 was a little outrageous
13:47 VolCrush: TY

13:52 Dimka: Al, my average for shares is 14.50 or so, still ways to go
13:52 VolCrush: i was waitin for a pivot, i saw the 1740, so wasnt sure if we were tracking the same trigger
13:53 TnT: 7 min to bondage
13:53 tmoney20g: usually a bottom forms around 10:20am, dunno why i didn't wait longer
13:53 tmoney20g: and that low was at 10:16

15:09 VolCrush: anyone trade /hg?
15:09 TnT: been watching hg closely
15:09 VolCrush: bronx only has a blind spot for der Wogel
15:09 blondetrader: lol Dan probably
15:09 RandomDan: I was unable to get USCR @31.5
15:10 blondetrader: but.....imagine lol....
15:10 VolCrush: kul, TnT.....i watch it for global macros
15:10 blondetrader: it would be typical potus...
15:10 TnT: /HG is curious, not buckling with world markets here
15:10 RandomDan: it would be, but the Chinese don't make decisions like that.
15:10 TnT: likewise Vol,  always watch it for da globe
15:11 streetglide: not sure there is enough time for a trade deal before elections
15:11 blondetrader: well they might be convinced
15:11 blondetrader: no street not on dotted line
15:11 blondetrader: but
15:11 streetglide: in principle.....maybe yes
15:11 blondetrader: an agreement......
15:11 TnT: Xi wants the "corrrect" party to win the house, he does not care what Trump wants
15:11 blondetrader: a handshake
15:11 blondetrader: of course tnt
15:12 blondetrader: but
15:12 blondetrader: will that manuver screw him if he doesnt get the outcome he wants
15:12 RandomDan: yeah, I agree with TnT
15:12 TnT: thus, there will be no handshake until after election
15:12 blondetrader: again like this is deal today......might not be as sweet come nov 7
15:12 blondetrader: deal with the devil u know type thing
15:13 RandomDan: smacks of desperation
15:13 TnT: Xi does not believe in the devil, he is a communist
15:13 RandomDan: and actually I don't think Trump is desperate to do a deal
15:13 blondetrader: all I know if we rally on china deal talks b4 election u all owe me candy
15:13 streetglide: lol
15:13 TnT: ok
15:14 TnT: lemmon drops?
15:14 blondetrader: well neither are desperate
15:14 blondetrader: gummy bears
15:14 VolCrush: well any deal is based on how Americans vote, so one may be placing a loss loss bet

15:22 TnT: I did not study hard enough for that many tests
15:22 streetglide: raise taxes for Buffet and Soros and the likes to 65%
15:22 RandomDan: I have URI at 112.50 now
15:22 VolCrush: FU, street
15:23 RandomDan: will add some uscr
15:23 RandomDan: looking for other infra like that
15:23 streetglide: and Vol to 70% for cussing
15:23 amalia: VC, they gonna censor you
15:23 TnT: Cat always gets a cut on infra-structure
15:23 RandomDan: worst outcome is not too bad because those sticks have been crushed
15:24 VolCrush: when dont they, @amalia?
15:24 RandomDan: yeah.. CAT what worries me is China exposure
15:24 amalia: lol
15:24 TnT: don't they just crank out replica Cat's?
15:24 RandomDan: I am looking for local infra plays.
15:25 RandomDan: TnT yes but if China is slowing...
15:25 TnT: I don't know what the project list looks like, hopefully a lot of bridge repairs and replacements
15:26 RandomDan: look at cat today vs URI or USCR
15:26 featherweight: APIs are a nail biter today!
15:26 TnT: when China is "slowing" it just means growing at a bit of lower pace
15:27 amalia: It's 28th place
15:27 amalia: We placed 1st
15:27 RandomDan: I realize that TnT, but still.
15:29 AlphaInvestor: I think CAT must have talked during their conference call again
15:30 streetglide: lol
15:30 TnT: another rosey optimist outlook?
15:30 JoshuaK: Do you guys got any recommended sources for historical intraday market data?
15:30 AlphaInvestor: P.S. long CAT*
15:31 amalia: Me too
15:32 AlphaInvestor: I bet my entry price is loer ;-)
15:32 TnT: 16:32 News Bot: US API Weekly Crude Stocks (8 Oct) +9.88mln vs. Exp. +3.7mln (Prev. -2.13mln)
15:32 TnT: wow
15:32 TnT: random # gen gone wild
15:32 AlphaInvestor: wholey frijoles
15:32 streetglide: EIA will be a draw
15:32 amalia: I would bet it is, Ai.
15:33 TnT: did not take out earlier low yet
15:33 AlphaInvestor: 9 fills today
15:34 TnT: /RB down almost 8 cents AI, fill your vehicles too
15:34 streetglide: maybe news leaked mid day, tnt
15:34 RandomDan: CAT gets hit by lower mineral prices too, mining is a big customer
15:35 TnT: lot of cats in strip mining, but copper holding up decent
15:36 TnT: they strip mine, then send AI in to plant new forests when they are done
15:36 RandomDan: EVs help copper. An EV uses like six times the copper of a regular car.
15:37 TnT: but then housing starts kills a lot of copper demand
15:37 RandomDan: yes, that's true
15:38 TnT: at least they don't do aluminum anymore after all the houses burned down
15:38 streetglide: why would housing starts kill demand?
15:38 RandomDan: yeah that was mostly down to the connections.
15:39 TnT: lower #'s of housing starts from higher rates
15:39 RandomDan: lower housing starts
15:39 streetglide: yes lower
15:39 TnT: yes Dan, was tragic decision
