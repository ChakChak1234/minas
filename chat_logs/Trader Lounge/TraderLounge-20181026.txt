19:16 radon224: No, I want to watch Asia Open
19:16 radon224: Japan open now
19:16 TnT: /vx on hgihgs
19:16 TnT: highs
19:17 ameriman: He/she was on mobile using the rebecca name
19:17 TnT: /nkd down 155
19:18 radon224: but Nikkei Index is +140
19:18 radon224: according to what I watch
19:19 tmoney20g: bloom says nikkei +154
19:20 ameriman: Must be news from earlier today when it was up
19:20 radon224: I have a pretty good source for RT Index info on all the world markets.  It's handy
19:21 TnT: all about change from  yesterday, so Nikkei up, but /NKD down compared to US futures closing
19:21 radon224: correct
19:22 TheOnceAndFuture: Guessing it will follow today's US trend
19:23 efu: n 225  up 201
19:23 tommyo: So many issues WAY down aftermarket...did some of the earnings disappoint or is there another catalyst taking place?
19:24 tmoney20g: some earnings dissappointed, yes
19:25 chenmannmobile: besides intc and cmg, all were bad,,,
19:25 chenmannmobile: on my watch list anyway
19:25 Sam: Amazon disappointed earning bring stocks down in eve hours
19:25 chenmannmobile: yes
19:25 TheOnceAndFuture: I wouldn't say they dissappointed so much as the market's expectations are way too high
19:26 Sam: But market will come back tommorrow.
19:26 TheOnceAndFuture: Truly, the quarterly reports are now a burden rather than a boon
19:27 tommyo: AMZN summary bubble says 3.77 was the estimate, 5.75 actual!!!  Must have had some guidance that was less than encouraging...
19:27 TnT: as rates rise, other investments become more competitive
19:27 Sam: Agree but now a days people needs to see nit beat earned ng along witg dales but 2018 future guidrnce. Any numbers werk, good stocks taking hit.
19:27 TheOnceAndFuture: These stocks were much more inflated than their peers IMO
19:28 TheOnceAndFuture: AMD is a case example
19:28 blondetrader: Let’s hope for those lows in am
19:28 TheOnceAndFuture: Lows and thn perhaps buying will resume
19:28 radon224: You gonna jinx it again bt
19:28 TheOnceAndFuture: Still sticking to that
19:28 blondetrader: Then we can at least put lows to rest
19:28 tmoney20g: yea
19:28 tmoney20g: i like buying calls better anyway
19:28 blondetrader: Lol I am mkt just needs to see it my way
19:29 Sam: Semiconductor stocks, stay away
19:29 blondetrader: If we can get them and close over key levels we can get a good rally
19:29 blondetrader: 1-3 weeks
19:29 tmoney20g: rally starts monday
19:30 tmoney20g: we can wash this week off friday at 4pm
19:30 radon224: A bazillion traders are waiting for a low open, retest of some key lows, and then jump in.  So it's not gonna happen.
19:30 radon224: I'm cynical this evening
19:30 TheOnceAndFuture: I say mid to late next week
19:30 Sam: Fed needs to sliw diwn and tarrifs is killer. Semiconductir will bounce back once tarrifs is settled.
19:30 tmoney20g: ok, how about nov 1
19:30 TheOnceAndFuture: small bounce, and then retesting of yesterday
19:31 blondetrader: Lol well I think retail may get spooked and a new low
19:31 TnT: way weird after 8 years peeps just think it should keep going up and no bear mkt ever again, very funny
19:31 tmoney20g: still have earnings till mid nov
19:31 TnT: tarrifs are not the issue
19:31 Sam: Costco earning??
19:31 TnT: markets have cycles
19:31 blondetrader: Well es closes over 65 tomorrow regardless of intraday
19:32 amalia: oh?
19:32 blondetrader: Where inteaday
19:33 TheOnceAndFuture: earnings will bounce us to around mid-september levels before a further correction beginning next year
19:33 blondetrader: Well I think 2850s need to be revisited
19:33 chenmannmobile: wow
19:33 blondetrader: And if that breaks new highs possible
19:34 blondetrader: That level should be new decision point via weekly
19:34 chenmannmobile: only if china deal
19:34 chenmannmobile: imo
19:34 TheOnceAndFuture: I think so too
19:34 TheOnceAndFuture: only if there's good news regarding tariffs
19:35 blondetrader: Well China would do the trick
19:35 TnT: I need a drag off of whatever you peeps are smoking
19:35 chenmannmobile: ha
19:35 TheOnceAndFuture: heh
19:35 chenmannmobile: i m kinda with u tnt
19:35 chenmannmobile: bt s the big bull
19:36 blondetrader: Haha
19:36 TnT: bt, Xi not gonna do nuttin til after election
19:36 blondetrader: Well I make no prediction over 2850
19:36 TheOnceAndFuture: I'm not as optimistic as bt but after what we saw in 2017 I believe these millis will pump anything
19:36 blondetrader: But if we get these stupid lows we go
19:36 chenmannmobile: mid term, fed, china .....just too much unknows out there
19:37 TheOnceAndFuture: where do you see the floor?
19:37 blondetrader: Nq 6740isg
19:37 TnT: fed hike is in Dec, they may not want to interfere with santa claus, but then again...
19:37 TheOnceAndFuture: you think they'll back off?
19:37 chenmannmobile: fed loco
19:38 blondetrader: Es a smidge lower than yest
19:38 blondetrader: Rty possible 1450s
19:38 TnT: they could back off if major market sell off
19:38 tmoney20g: fed cares not
19:38 blondetrader: But the reversal would need to be quick off that
19:38 blondetrader: Like a veee bottom
19:39 radon224: Fed will hike in Dec.  If they don't, it's because some sort of DOOM occured between now and then.
19:39 TnT: wall street cries, they go oh, sorry
19:39 TnT: yes radon, that is what I am saying
19:39 chenmannmobile: like the last half hour yesterday?...look what happened today
19:39 TnT: downturn in market, they will fold

06:26 EasyE: haha
06:26 RandomDan: take money, run
06:26 MakingDOE: thanks for the help
06:27 MakingDOE: it's not the right amount glta
06:30 RandomDan: shorts are at risk here. market could easily rally after opening selloff
06:31 RandomDan: if you have an expiring position with profit, take it
06:32 MakingDOE: that's not the problem,, the amount is wrong it's
06:32 RandomDan: not necesarily
06:33 RandomDan: iv could be up
06:33 RandomDan: there were monster bid-ask spreads up to a few minutes ago
06:34 RandomDan: the goog bid recovered $28 in 45 minutes
06:35 RandomDan: it was at $1012
06:35 MakingDOE: this is SPY
06:35 RandomDan: I know
06:35 MakingDOE: the last price on watchlist shows 270 and it's trading at 265 it's weong

06:36 MakingDOE: I know but
06:36 RandomDan: last has no value here
06:36 MakingDOE: i know when you look at options chain no movement
06:37 RandomDan: the market is at bid ask
06:37 MakingDOE: so no put option value real time ah on spt?
06:37 MakingDOE: spy
06:39 RandomDan: nope
06:39 MakingDOE: well lol there lies the problem
06:40 blondetrader: gm
06:41 MakingDOE: so I'd it's at 265 and I'm at 268 I'm thinking nice pay day at open even though a 24x5 SPY can show real-time b and a but not realtime options prices with correlating nprofit lol
06:48 efu: everything is strongly, deeply fine lol
06:51 efu: the spaceship will pick you up soon
06:52 efu: especially if you move to oklahoma

06:55 blondetrader: mid 50s is the low point
06:55 Eedie: Thanks
06:55 RandomDan: hi bt, ee
06:55 Eedie: Hello Dan
06:55 EasyE: makingDOE your options position will update at open. I'm in the same boat with qqq puts gonna close the put at open and hope trump ends tariffs and the fed says they wont raise rate in dec so I can make $$$ on the calls from my straddle. I can dream.
06:56 RandomDan: this is fine
06:57 RandomDan: just not sure how to trade it for maximum effect
07:02 RandomDan: blonde, rty low was 1470, or am I missing something?
07:04 blondetrader: yes this am...I meant it can go as low as the mid 50s but need to close today over 83
07:04 RandomDan: got it
07:04 RandomDan: sounds reasonable.
07:05 blondetrader: if we can get that odds increase for sustaineable rally 1-3 weeks 
07:05 blondetrader: I will give tgts up this afternoon for hahas
07:06 RandomDan: me thinks toilet flush at the open, then another leg, then we stabilize and maybe even rally.
07:06 blondetrader: we r on same page
07:07 blondetrader: i am going to purchase some calls today

07:12 blondetrader: I am doing buys also prob on LULU MU DIS  calls prob cmg

07:14 blondetrader: rty nq mayber es

07:14 RandomDan: not sure, nvda seems like it should go like a rocket at the turn
07:14 RandomDan: more than mu

07:19 RandomDan: I think the number is 185, but I suck at TA
07:19 AlphaInvestor: DOE - you can learn and implement the Black-Scholes model to calculate the current price of options outside of RTH
07:20 blondetrader: 192-86 nvda
07:20 RandomDan: I don't think there is anything at 170
07:20 RandomDan: 192?
07:21 blondetrader: yes
07:21 AlphaInvestor: DOE - You will need to use the Greeks to estimate changes in IV
07:21 MakingDOE: thx Dan I will
07:21 RandomDan: seems a little high but you got your spells
07:21 blondetrader: 186 too
07:21 blondetrader: those r 2 key

07:22 blondetrader: 220-227
07:22 blondetrader: nvda if my S holds
07:22 RandomDan: your S?
07:22 blondetrader: also worth noting a reversal there by close over 210 is A ok
07:22 blondetrader: support
07:22 AlphaInvestor: I am underwater on my NVDA pcs... those levels are meaningless to me

10:34 MTS1: Barefoot; can look at VWAP for example
10:35 profit_recon: hey guys anyone have suggestion for study that would be useful for wave counts or something similiar to elliott wave or pivots base on candle action within time period rather than daily weekly or monthly?
10:36 Farmin: lwe, ToS does not generally support thinkscript triggering actual trades.  the exception is the use of very simple codes in Conditional Orders
10:36 MTS1: lwe? You can use TS to test strategies on chart and report. Limited conditional order TS capabiity to use to trigger orders; test as MarketWatch alerts which has the same limitations: If you get reliable alerts when expected you should be able to use as conditional order script.
10:38 barefoot: got it.  Thx Mobius and MTS1.
10:39 Farmin: profit, play with the zigzag script.  may not be exactly what you are looking for, but it is what exists
10:41 lwe1: So no algo trading with TOS using ThinkScript?
10:42 Farmin: NOPE
10:43 lwe1: Thank You
10:44 profit_recon: @farmin thanks will check
10:49 Daytrader71: good afternoon guys, looking for some help on a script , Parabolic Sar when crossover to support and "di" positive crossover over "di" negative will give the buy signal.�After the buy signal is given.�Stop order will be set 2 points from entry price. ( Please make this adjustable so I can tweak)Exit signal will be when Parsar crossover to resistance and whenever "di" negative crossover "di" positive to confirm sell.Would like to see the "Buy" , "Stop", "Exit" on chart if possible.
10:49 Daytrader71: any help is appreciated!
10:54 Jowy: Thanks MTS1!
10:58 Farmin: lose the bold italics
11:02 Daytrader71: sorry about that I had it written and when I copy I guess it was bold in writing
11:03 Daytrader71: ok thanks
11:03 Ben: Thanks mobius will do
11:06 Daytrader71: Good afternoon, 
11:09 Daytrader71: parabolic sar when crossover to support and "di"  positive crossover over the "Di" Negative will give a buy signal. Stop order will be set 2 pts below entry entry. (Please make this adjustable so I can tweak) Exit signal will be when parar sar crossover to resistance and "di" positive crossover to negative to sell. Would like to see "Buy" "Stop", "Sell" on chart if possible. Thanks.
11:09 Mobius: Daytrader - Copy and paste both those studies to a new strategy. the change the plot lines to def lines of code. The add the buy and sell orders with the conditions you want
11:10 Mobius: hmm my n key must have peanut butter in it
11:11 Mobius: Daytrader - exit the room and reenter to reset your font. White font doesnt show on a white background
11:11 Daytrader71: Mobius. thanks. do you know where I can go to learn the script better?
11:12 Mobius: always best to start with the manual so you don't blow your new toy up - http://tlc.thinkorswim.com/center/charting/thinkscript.html
11:17 Mobius: Big Picture Stuff:  /ES bouced right off the lower Long Term Balance area set starting in last Feb.  And has broken below trend support lines. Wake me up when we hit $2550
 
11:25 Vimes: Mobius has the best toys
11:25 Paris: Daytrader - this is actually the best place to learn about ThinkScript, it may take some time but like many of us, you'll get there. Take care
11:30 Lei: Anyone with feelings about YERX
11:36 Mobius: On track for a 4mil cont day for /ES. That could make today the second biggest of the year. 4.7mil is the title holder  
11:37 Mobius: If we go green the urge to climb on board the rally train may turn into a stampede
11:38 Vimes: from markets in turmoil to a market rally
11:38 Paris: I for one will be really keen to see the EWI short term forecasts (due after the close today).
11:39 SuperBall: are there other indicators similar to or better than the ATR?
11:41 Mobius: better for what?
11:41 Mobius: ATR == AverageTrueRange.  It is what it is
11:42 Vimes: keltner channels, bol bands, guess all depends on use
11:42 mcdon0301: mobius. is your balance prive always set to to length 4 weekly?
11:43 SuperBall: tell me if the range are getting smaller, for scalping.
11:43 Mobius: You can modify it by a price filter such as HeikenAshi or a polynomial filter like Laguerre or a normalized price filter like Gaussian
11:43 SuperBall: maybe speed too.
11:44 Mobius: Super.. The only way to make it any faster is to shorten the length being compared.
11:45 SuperBall: run two charts?  how about taking the derivative?
11:47 Mobius: ok what will that do for you?
11:47 SuperBall: Mobius, what do you make of the /es run from late last year to january compared to the recent rally, before these two rallies falthered?  the two peaks strength looks to be divergent.
11:48 SuperBall: measure the speed of the ATR, if calculus can be done does it make sense?
11:50 Mobius: Super.. your measuring absolute points in a time series. You either modify that series length or the points being measured. It's just that simple. I've already told you above how to do that
11:51 SuperBall: okay, i'll figure it out, thank you.
11:51 Mobius: nothing to figure out. All those suggestions are already coded by me and in MyTrade
11:52 Vimes: Super, just out of personal curiosity i've always though of expanding volatility as the opportunity what about a narrowing ATR would you scalp?
11:56 SuperBall: the ATR gets bigger as the volatility/range expands, as the price range narrows the indicator trends down whether the price goes up/down/sideways.
11:57 SuperBall: so i am thinking to avoid scalping when it narrows.
11:57 Vimes: k thx
11:58 Mobius: Super - look at the ECI (Expansion Contraction Indicator) on MyTrade
11:59 Mobius: It plots a channel marking areas of volatility compression
11:59 SuperBall: i can't take the derivative of a constant, it would just be zero. lol.
11:59 Vimes: well the atr is not a consant, just not sure what hte rate of change would tell you, plot it and see
12:00 SuperBall: Okay, I will look for it.  Thanks Mobius.
12:00 Mobius: yw
12:00 Vimes: maybe trade at the invlection
12:00 Vimes: inflection
12:01 poseidon77: Trying to plot AccountNetLiq but it always returns N/A .... what am I doing wrong?
12:02 Mobius: Problem with any volatility squeeze is knowing which way it will break out. It's common for price to breakout of a compression one way just to turn in a few bars and go the other way.
12:16 DMonkey: Atr volume rank percentage. Hahaha
12:16 John1a: Moon shot reversal, pun intended :)
12:17 bmckinney: How do I make a script in my scanner settings that says something like,
 "close is within 5% of the 20 day high  OR  close is within 5% of the 50 day high"  
I want to be able to give that option to choose instead of creating a separate scanner.
12:19 Nube: RE volatility, not ready yet but the abnormal volatility idea combined with FE might have potential
12:22 Vimes: BM, check the built in price_change study/filter on the scanner
12:25 Mobius: This Study plots Flags, Compression Areas, Shelves, Balance Areas about as fast and cleanly as I've seen
#hint: Expansion Contraction Indicator (ECI): \n ECI Identifies areas of price compression which leads to price expansion. ECI doesn't show the direction of a trend but does indicate when a trend is going to resume (price flagging) or if a change in trend polarity is happening.\n ECI plots the areas where price becomes compressed with colored and clouded bands. The indicator also leaves legacy points in areas of past compression.
# ECI is based on the FE algorithm 
# Original plot style by Mobius
# Note: Default Lengths are not optimized. My personal experience has been length ranges between 8 and 13 are generally effective.
# Here's another way to look at Fractal Energy. This study plots it on the chart graph with clouded areas for the current price compression, exhaustion area and leaves colored points as a legacy plot for past areas.
# Good CSA choices with this study are:
# ECI + SuperTrend + Fractal Pivots
# ECI + SuperTrend + RSI in Laguerre Time
# ECI + SuperTrend + Standard Deviation Bands
# ECI + Linear Regression Standard Deviation Bands
# This version Modified to filter price to a normalized distribution

12:29 Lei: Sorry YEXT
12:30 Vimes: try the trader forum Lei
12:31 Lei: Thank you.
12:36 Mobius: I've added tha above study to MyTrade. Leaving room fo 2 more studies. And I still need 14 more to make 1,000 followers.
12:41 bkstrader: Now its 13 Mobius you have great scripts
12:42 neo_theone: mobius i was looking at the /ES after your wake up call. is it  correct that it started down on oct 3, after it tried to mach 9/21 high and it couldnt (may be butter was melting in the heat)
12:44 bmckinney: Vimes: Price_Change doesn't tell me near highs
12:49 decoder: hi, i use the obv "on balance volume" on the chart, how can i displace it so it wont be on top of the candles? anybody?
12:52 Mobius: neo... That's a polarity change from /ES setting new higher highs and higher lows to new lower highs and lower lows.
12:53 Mobius: decoder add a plot line well above an OBV high and that will push it down
12:53 neo_theone: thankyou
12:58 decoder: thanks Mobious  ill try that but i really want to displace it forward or backward a few periods.
13:00 Mobius: decoder - Sorry that doesn't compute.
13:01 decoder: thanks!
13:02 Mobius: If you copy and paste the TOS native study to a new study and want to use that lower study on the upper chart you have to add a plot line that will be well above the original oscillator in order to push the oscillator down below the candles
13:03 Mobius: That added plot line can be drawn the same color as your background color so that it doesn't show
13:06 decoder: thanks Mobious ill try that :)
13:07 Paris: FrankB3 - Just cleared the chat logs for the past 2 days and noticed your post regarding cycle studies. Sounds like Mobius may be posting some cycle studies in due course (according to his comment yesterday). You might like to wait for that. If not, contact me offline as I'm in the midst of a house move and may not be actively monitoring the chat
13:10 Vimes: BM, sorry there is another one then that is near high and lows, if not you can easliy code a custom one
13:12 Vimes: Just takes some digging,
13:26 sassy911: Can you put more than one price time frame on a single chart? 20 min and 60 min.
13:26 Vimes: Decoder, if you are talking about the paint order, the last study in each panel gets painted last or overlays the other
13:40 JohnnyQuotron: Mobius... the ECI you posted today.. it is quite different from other ECI scripts of yours which i have in the OneNote.   It looks to me to have a Gaussian Filter.  Is that correct?  and are there other changes which I should note?  Thank you.Please feel free to reply  after the close if that would be better for you.
13:43 3x_: question about using TOS:
13:44 3x_: is there a way to temporarily hide all lines, studies, drawings?
13:45 Vimes: style/settings/show studies, you can add it as a quick select on the style menu
13:45 3x_: hoping there's a modifier key or combination press-and-hold on a chart to see it without any of my overlays — just for a sec at a time
13:51 Mobius: Like Dad used to say hope and wish in one hand and spit in the other. Which gets full faster?
13:52 Mobius: Johnny.. Yes price is filtered on that study to move it to a normalized range.  Notes are in the study header also.
13:53 Mobius: That is the only study of that sort I actually use. It's also one of my favorites.
13:58 Mobius: We have well over 100 points of travel in /ES today. Starting to feel like just a touch of volatility is back
14:02 Nube: That filter was too good to give away. I'm not giving it back though. I use it in everything now.
14:09 JohnnyQuotron: Mobius.. thank you.  A point of clarification.. you prefer this measure of FE to the Gaussed plot of FE in the RSI-Laguerre with Gaussian Filter?
14:09 Nube: I lied, haven't found it's use for volune yet
14:15 JohnnyQuotron: Inappropriate market comment...  this kind of action makes perfect sense when P/Es OVER adjust to lower earnings growth rate projections in the "Out" years vs next year.  (2020 EPS growth < 2019 EPS growth.   What's the right multiple? )
14:19 Nube: Whatever multiple gets es to 5k
14:19 Mobius: Johnny - I use an RSI Laguerre also Gaussian Filtered. What I like about the study posted earlier today is the way it identifies flags quickly and plots a channel that expands to indicate a probable breakout
14:21 JohnnyQuotron: Agreed.   I find the visual of the eci preferrable as well.  It "speaks" to me more clearly than the FE plot in the RSI Laguerre with Gaussian FIlter.
14:21 Vimes: it is a beauty
14:21 Mobius: Example:  /ES  just hit the Implied move formed a flag then moved up toward the Probable move. Giving context to price action
14:22 JohnnyQuotron: one more question  are you watching/trading 5min or 2min /es today?  
14:22 Mobius: 2
14:23 Vimes: yeah who doesn't like 12 point scalps
14:24 cajun: Mobius looks like we'll end w SPX having a double "inside day'. do u read this set up as a probable reversal for monday?
14:24 Mobius: trading 60 points on intraday is kinda nice. Too bad it's not every day.
14:25 Mobius: cajun - /ES is a continuation day not inside. I always refer to /ES and never SPX
14:26 JohnnyQuotron: ty..  
14:26 Mobius: As to Monday - Too much possible news for me to even guess
14:26 cajun: oooh.  thx Mobius
14:27 Vimes: spx, though is not an inside day
14:29 Mobius: yeah  SPX is also a continuation day
14:29 JohnnyQuotron: vs wednesday?
14:20 Lee: FSLR way oversold. But that bad guidance will take a long while to work off. But its a bargin
14:21 VolCrush: GE type of bargain?
14:22 TnT: Lehman Brothers kind of bargain?
14:22 Lee: Lol.
14:22 ilt: Alright I am staying short
14:22 ilt: Let’s see what Monday brings
14:22 Lee: Those were fun days
14:23 TnT: yes, so much fun they made a movie about it
14:23 TnT: more than one
14:23 blondetrader: rty giving it another go
14:23 blondetrader: if we get back to the 1495 zone i exepct a NSH for today
14:24 Lee: I had some puts. Sold way to early. I was skeered
14:25 stockhawk: lee> nothing with being scared. if not sure get out.
14:25 VolCrush: and if not sure get in
14:25 stockhawk: lol
14:26 Lee: Straight down for weeks is a scarry thing to watch
14:26 ilt: Lol
14:26 stockhawk: it s like catching falling knives
14:26 VolCrush: y just short it
14:26 mthfr_vaxxed: put options working beautifully... finally making some money
14:26 efu: IF  = largest word in english
14:27 stockhawk: someone on CNBC just said she believe this bull market will continue.
14:27 VolCrush: those she work for golman sucks?
14:27 stockhawk: yeah, but i am sure she liquidated her portfolio quietly.
14:28 VolCrush: absolutely
14:28 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Stock, it could, but no sign of that yet
14:28 ilt: I told folks market is getting hammered the other day they said time to buy
14:28 ilt: Idk everyone has an opinion man
14:29 stockhawk: it s like screaming fire in a movie theater.
14:29 stockhawk: not enough exits
14:30 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I agree though, not enough bears around on tv.  that is a concern.
14:30 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Actually not one bear.  all in hibernation.
14:30 stockhawk: it s because they do not want mass redemtions which in turn create more downdraft.
14:31 VolCrush: ah u want bulls pounding the table, thats when you know the selling isnt over, when they all pound the table bear is when it is over
14:31 stockhawk: redemptions
14:32 TnT: 2009, it was Cramer that finally got skeered and told peeps to get out  was the bottom
14:32 TnT: was hilarious
14:32 stockhawk: this time it s me lol
14:32 VolCrush: welp and with der S&P in the red, lots of bonuses wont be paid, they will fight like hell to get it in the black by EOY
14:32 Lee: The Hogan bottom. March 09
14:33 lilFish: vol did you get out of you aapl 215 put?
14:33 VolCrush: NEVER had one
14:33 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: bigworm will appreciate this comment  :)   I did research and read papers 1 month before and during the 29 crash.   Everybody was still  bullish!    
14:34 VolCrush: i got out of AMZN pcs this a.m.
14:34 stockhawk: thanks my other
14:34 lilFish: oh i thought you went short aapl at 215
14:34 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: that was Haines, Lee
14:34 VolCrush: i shorted the Qs
14:35 lilFish: when?
14:35 VolCrush: today
14:35 VolCrush: and yesterday, yesterdays i covered today and then put another short on today
14:35 VolCrush: jeeez im runnin out of shorts
14:36 VolCrush: may have to go nekked
14:36 Lee: Art Hogan. A CNBC commentator. Beat oh is desk one day and said ‘damn it. This selling is enough. ‘.
14:36 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: me too.  time to wash
14:36 Lee: He has since passed away
14:36 radon224: That was Mark Haines
14:37 lilFish: the haines bottom
14:37 blondetrader: jump
14:37 Lee: Oh
14:37 Lee: Lol.
14:37 TnT: I like Hanes, good underwear
14:37 lilFish: might as well jump
14:37 TnT: Hanes bottom
14:37 lilFish: correctomundo
14:38 Lee: Ya mean ive been wrong all tgese years?
14:38 TnT: now the song fish, go ahead and jump!
14:38 stockhawk: My otherBrother>   i am glad you did some research.
14:38 lilFish: maybe you were thinkin hogan's heros:)
14:38 VolCrush: y delay the inevitable just sell this thing wit volume in the next 22
14:38 TnT: Shultz
14:38 VolCrush: love hogans hereos
14:39 VolCrush: u know hogan was murdered
14:39 lilFish: right tnt that was the reference:)
14:39 Lee: Becker reruns. My fav
14:39 lilFish: i have to confess something
14:39 lilFish: i didnt play today
14:39 VolCrush: yes petit poisson
14:39 lilFish: looked too indecisive
14:39 VolCrush: dont worry u can play tonight all u want
14:40 lilFish: went to the b52s last nite:)
14:40 stockhawk: volcrush lol
14:30 bigworm: do you have your pairs trade during times like this mobius or do you switch to something else
14:30 Mobius: vs any day.  Trend is down and today added to that not take away
14:30 Vimes: well on my charts /es broke teh lower range of 10/24 and 10/25
14:31 Mobius: big.. I focus on intraday with markets like this. I short as many as 10 contracts a trade to protect my investments.
14:31 cajun: Vimes, just bodies count for inside days,,,, i think
14:31 bigworm: ok.. does your NN pickup times like this to not enter or exit pairs or is it manual?
14:32 Vimes: cajun, not for me
14:32 Mobius: manual - I literally clear all short term trades and turn it off.
14:32 cajun: oooo...different strokes
14:32 Vimes: price traded outside the range, right?
14:33 bigworm: ok thanks for taking time to answer a poor college kid
14:34 Mobius: keep learning and poor will take care of itself. Never trade because you have to. Trade when you should
14:35 bigworm: I have to pick a project for this term.  you had said you use PCA to select your beta and length for the gaussian smoother?
14:37 Mobius: if your looking for a project - a gaussian filter is a form of infinite impluse - consider building one with an error correction algorithm where length is the ec and beta is a fraction of that factor.
14:38 Vimes: woudn't PCA need a static time invariant data set i guess you could build a lagged data variable into the PCA data
14:39 Mobius: you can build the ec model with I(1) >< I(0) as the control
14:39 bigworm: im trying to absorb what you just wrote
14:40 Mobius: well you've got all weekend  :)
14:40 jason1419: Hi guys! Been reading and youtubing ThinkScript for two days now and I feel like this should be an easy script but I'm having trouble making it work. Can someone point me in the right direction? I want to put a callout bubble on my chart marking the close but only on specific days (Bubble 1 - three days ago, bubble 2 - seventeen days ago etc). I can add the bubbles, but it puts a million of them across the screen like a plot line instead of just the couple of days I want marked.
14:41 bigworm: ok so what youre saying is get some type of impulse response function that measures how big what youre trying to smoooth moves and take a fraction of that to filter out the smaller moves
14:41 Mobius: jason - the first variable in a bubble is the x axis and the second is the y.  If your x is open eneded you will plot all the way from it's start to the end of the data
14:43 Farmin: aka a low pass filter?
14:43 bigworm: yeah
14:44 Mobius: big - no that's what the gaussian filter does. However, the filter itself is an infinite impulse and so it's deterministic output is directly related to the length of data being used . Alter that using the beta and an error correction algorithm
14:45 bigworm: ahh ok
14:45 Mobius: In essence you will build a Neural Net
14:45 amalia: Yeah that’s what I was thinking too O_o
14:46 bigworm: i get what youre saying now youre saying to use it as an input
14:46 Mobius: A simple single Neuron single Node Net
14:46 Vimes: if that was to me, what i mean was in the process industry we could build a lagged vector to try and account for the autocorrealtion [x(t);x(t-1);...etc] pca and other methods can then give you insight to if these lagged dimensions are giving you any predictive power
14:46 bigworm: that does sound like a good project. Thanks for the idea!!!
14:47 bigworm: we just went over monte carlo methods and i thought it would be more complex
14:52 cajun: bigworm, when youre done, bring it back to share
14:52 bigworm: i have no problem with sharing... problem is sharing in thinkscript
14:53 Mobius: You've got to be pretty creative to get some of the needed functions to code in ThinkScript
14:53 bigworm: i actually dont do thinkscript.  I could learn, cant be harder than python or c++
14:53 bigworm: yeah right now all we do is kernels
14:54 FrankB3: Looks like Mr. Mo is right  about /ES heading up in close ... good deal will colse out all stock @107.70       http://tos.mx/jFL77x#
14:54 bigworm: that might be hard if you cant train in here
14:54 bigworm: wth looping and such
14:54 Farmin: well, sharing is only a problem if you make it one... there's MyTrade, UTC's OneNote, or his other thing, JQ's OneNote, etc...
14:54 bigworm: yeah from what little research I have done i post it up
14:55 bigworm: no problem sharing that in what I code in either.
14:56 bigworm: time is a factor as well.  im trying to graduate by spring so im doing full course load with more difficult stats courses so finding time to make code look good and usable isnt relly my priority when i am taking on projects at the moment
14:57 bigworm: I have coded up some good classifers in another language using kernels I could share
14:59 jason1419: Thanks Mobius. I must be calling the day wrong. Modifying the TS script from the formatting output chapter I tried this which I would think would limit my X per your instructions above, but I'm getting the same result.
def today = getDay();
AddChartBubble(today, close, "mark");
15:01 jason1419:  
15:01 Nube: Jason, try getday is equal to GetLastDay
15:02 jason1419: Tried that too. same result
15:02 jason1419: Was originally going to use get last day and offset it the number of days i wanted
15:03 Mobius: jason x must be a unique bar
15:04 Nube: Ah, those aren't daily bars.
15:05 jason1419: Right, having trouble figuring out how to define that.
15:06 Mobius: GetDay() != GetLastDay() is a unique bar
secondsFromTime(0930) is a single bar that happens each day
isNaN(close[3]) and !isNaN(close[4]) is a unique bar that moves with the current bar
15:08 bigworm: mobius do you think incorporating GARCH in a neural network is useful for forecasting or will a deep neural net perform just as well at forecasting volatility?
15:08 bigworm: without the garch
15:10 Mobius: TO GARCH or not to GARCH whether it is more noble to ARCH or ARMA is all in the eye of the beholder
15:10 bigworm: lol
15:11 bigworm: you make me laugh sometimes
15:11 bigworm: we should write a broadway show
15:12 Mobius: You have to decide based on use. There's no one right answer
15:12 jason1419: Thanks. Will chew on that for a bit.
15:13 Mobius: Your starting out from the same base - a regression analysis. In the end what model are you more comfortable with.
15:14 bigworm: I feel there is less complexity with the GARCH
15:14 bigworm: but i also am just being exposed to NN
15:15 bigworm: so by the end of the year I will have a better opinon.  
15:15 bigworm: I have to go do some kernelized ridge regression on MNIST now have a good day
15:16 Mobius: Read Plato's Cave. It applies to your perspective
15:16 bigworm: ok :)
15:16 Mobius: The one thing that is for sure is - change  :)
15:08 TnT: betting odds have house  flip to dem  control at 62.2%, so could go either way
15:08 fred__w: i dont think the election has any impact  none whatsoever
15:08 stockhawk: fredw> agree:)
15:08 TnT: it makes a huge difference who wins the House
15:09 blondetrader: agreed
15:09 TnT: really huge
15:09 blondetrader: this is particularly important
15:09 TnT: that is the main focus
15:09 fred__w: tnt  clearly we disagree then
15:09 stockhawk: november should  bring a lot more fireworks according to the cycles.
15:09 blondetrader: if new ownership then implies a reversal of tax cut
15:09 blondetrader: etc etc etc
15:10 TnT: more important than china trade
15:10 blondetrader: ^^^
15:10 blondetrader: but we will get a deal
15:10 SPYOPTS: markets were looking for reason(s) to sell and it played like perfect storm now
15:10 blondetrader: haha
15:10 SPYOPTS: rather playing
15:10 fred__w: bt  if you want to believe that  its yours
15:10 blondetrader: believe what?
15:10 TnT: well, wouldn't go that far bt, GOP keeps the Senate, odds very high
15:10 blondetrader: that elcetion important or china

15:10 blondetrader: well anything that doesnt disrupt ok with me
15:10 blondetrader: ahhh
15:11 blondetrader: well if I were a company I d want to keep my tax cut
15:11 stockhawk: news mean nothing cause the market dictates its agenda with time and levels, no matter what.
15:11 blondetrader: news yes
15:11 fred__w: bt  no argument there  i just dont see that affecting the mkt  is all
15:11 stockhawk: yes
15:12 blondetrader: but the election results may stall the yaya
15:12 TnT: that is what is at play here in this whole downturn
15:12 blondetrader: well i just think there is a lot more at stake than usual
15:12 TnT: ^^^^^^^^^
15:12 stockhawk: look.. earnings, low unemployment etc.... so what gives ?
15:12 blondetrader: well it gives under a red gov
15:12 stockhawk: its the cycles, period.

15:12 blondetrader: that ok 
15:13 fred__w: indeed
15:13 blondetrader: I am a mom used to peeps dissagreeing with me
15:13 TnT: ok, that is fine, no big deal
15:13 RandomDan: new ownershio of the house does not imply anything for the tax cut
15:13 RandomDan: nothin at all
15:13 TnT: I was just making my points,agreement not necessary
15:13 blondetrader: well when they say they want to amend it i think it dies
15:14 RandomDan: without the senate, they can't do a thing
15:14 TnT: well, unless both house and senate flip
15:14 blondetrader: yes and dependiong on what poll u pay att to a real nail bitter
15:14 stockhawk: october 24 th was the anniversary oof october 1929. 89 fib years ( blondetrader) :)
15:15 blondetrader: :)
15:15 RandomDan: if both flip that still doesn't affect the tax cut, no veto proof majority
15:15 TnT: true
15:15 blondetrader: well then they are talking out of thier ass
15:16 stockhawk: lol
15:16 blondetrader: bc they wanna so they say
15:16 RandomDan: on the contrary, gridlock guarantees status quo
15:16 blondetrader: and impeach bla bla bla

15:19 fred__w: uncertainty promotes volatility  and volatility is required to make money
