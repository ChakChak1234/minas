15:54 amalia: lol
15:54 streetglide: Ford and GE leading the markets
15:55 RandomDan: I sold off my remaining GE today. probably a mistake
15:56 streetglide: depending on your time horizon maybe
16:00 DrHouse: Positions improved since my last rant
16:01 amalia: Hope so
16:02 TnT: all have a good evening
16:05 DrHouse: Cya
16:05 amalia: Laters, TnT.
16:06 GraceGu: Hi , may I ask  your comments if TOS has the indice for Smart money flow chart? Thanks, 
16:06 amalia: Grace, do you have a link to the prospectus?
16:07 GraceGu: no
16:07 amalia: It would help.
16:08 amalia:  827 was BuySignal, fwiw.
16:08 ameriman: Grace what is the index for smart money flow?
16:09 GraceGu: yeah, I think the chart as you showed
16:09 GraceGu: it is what I want
16:09 GraceGu: would you mind to let me know how can I get the chart? I have no idea
16:09 amalia: lol 
16:10 amalia: GraceGu, i would contact support@thinkorswim.com and ask for a platform tour. Before the tour, I would write down at least 10 questions/inquiries and just have them show you everything, from top to bottom, inside and out.
16:11 GraceGu: that will be great, i appreciate !
16:11 ameriman: Grace you can call them also 866-839-1100
16:11 amalia: You're welcome. You can also call them at 866-839-1100
16:12 amalia: ameriman is the guru here. Ask him anything
16:12 GraceGu: yes, i can talk to them , thank you guys so much
16:12 amalia: =) 
16:15 tmoney20g: i'm back
16:21 amalia: THANK GAWDDDD
16:23 tmoney20g: srsly
16:23 tmoney20g: what would you do w/o me
16:24 amalia: lol
16:46 GraceGu: @amalia  Hi Amalia, I just talked to the support team, and was told  " there would not be any studies or pictures like that found on the prospectus"
16:47 GraceGu: i show them the picture for easy understanding
16:51 M-C-M: hi guys, i wonder if you encountered ever this issue. On ToS active trader, i cant drag the sell order up or down once i got a partial filling, the system says that can not safely calculate the amount of the remained shares... i chated ToS rebooted the app but still nothing, it does same thing. TY
16:54 amalia: GraceGu, I think our signals crossed earlier. That picture was not in any way a reference to your inquiry.
16:55 M-C-M: SO EVERYTIME I GOT PARTIAL FILLING I HAVE TO CANCEL THE ORDER, RECALCULATE REMAINed shares and put another one, not only frustrating but i lose pretious timemost of times losing money with this when i need speed selling by draging the sell order down
16:55 amalia: M-C-M, the complaint department can be reached at support@thinkorswim.com or by dialing 866-839-1100
16:56 M-C-M: i did, they rebooted my app but nothing, tired of starting disscussions again, i thought any of you had same issu, eventually i ll call again
16:57 amalia: Nope. Nothing on my end.
17:00 GraceGu: Is that a special access requirement to prospectus? I am trying to find it from website, but failed as well. so not sure if you can give me the link so I can have a study . thanks
17:25 mthfr_vaxxed: anyone short supermicro at the beginning of this month?
17:40 amalia: G60, outside links are NOT allowed.
17:40 amalia: Especially of another chat room.
17:58 RandomDan: anybody around?
17:58 TheOnceAndFuture: Eyoo
18:00 chenmannmobile: hey dan
18:01 RandomDan: hey chen
18:01 chenmannmobile: wild day ...haha
18:01 RandomDan: hey theonce
18:01 chenmannmobile: soh me
18:01 RandomDan: very wild
18:02 chenmannmobile: came way back but still ended down, and futures r down now
18:02 RandomDan: I complained I was bored yesterday, so I guess this is what I wanted!
18:02 chenmannmobile: ha
18:03 RandomDan: not a lot of conviction in the AH drop tho
18:04 chenmannmobile: u think this was a retest or still going lower?
18:04 chenmannmobile: no idea me
18:04 RandomDan: I think there won't be a major down move tomorrow. Too dangerous while goog earnings are pending
18:05 chenmannmobile: ya true lot of er coming up
18:05 RandomDan: at least for fang and fang followers
18:05 chenmannmobile: they sold off nflx, so fwiw
18:05 RandomDan: being short fang right now is a lottery ticket
18:06 RandomDan: they did, but it took a couple of days
18:06 RandomDan: if you shorted ahead of it, you got killed
18:07 RandomDan: the IV on goog options is unbelievable
18:08 RandomDan: it's going to evaporate, one way orthe other
18:11 chenmannmobile: i would ve feel a lot better if we came back all the way with green close, but still down so kinda lean towards the bear side still
18:12 ameriman: yea test of lows was on heavy volume
18:12 ameriman: expect a retest some time in future
18:13 chenmannmobile: i saw a big sell program when es broke 2698, looking back think that was just algos clearing stops, i guess there were a lots of stops below 2700
18:14 ameriman: yea 2700 has now become a very strong level
18:14 ameriman: PPT comes in every time at 2700
18:15 chenmannmobile: just crazy big range , 50 on es today, wow
18:16 chenmannmobile: and pot and tsla lead the come back, lol ,
18:16 chenmannmobile: beaver leading
18:16 chenmannmobile: lol
18:17 chenmannmobile: but again, didnt finish the job, gave it up at the close
18:17 ameriman: TLRY almost touched 100
18:18 chenmannmobile: i know, i saw but hesitated
18:18 chenmannmobile: it was fast anyway, right at the open so not sure could ve gotten filled
18:18 RandomDan: I was tempted but my no pot play policy still stands
18:18 Edwinsnts: What do you guys think about nvcn
18:19 Edwinsnts: With consolidation today
18:19 ameriman: This room has a no penny policy
18:19 RandomDan: no idea
18:20 Edwinsnts: With consolidation today
18:20 RandomDan: oh it's a penny? yep, no pennies in the lounge
18:20 ameriman: all the penny players here blew their accounts already and left
18:24 chenmannmobile: tos should have an overnight trading room
18:26 amalia: mhm
18:26 chenmannmobile: nqfomo came back today
18:26 chenmannmobile: lol
18:26 amalia: They used to leave the rooms open when we used to control the chats properly by ourselves.
18:27 amalia: Ah, that's nice.
18:27 chenmannmobile: every time market s about to crash he makes an appearence
18:27 amalia: haha
18:27 chenmannmobile: lol
18:27 chenmannmobile: no idea on market
18:28 chenmannmobile: nqfomo
18:28 chenmannmobile: just checking
18:28 chenmannmobile: ha
18:34 KyleTrader: Can I get someone’s opinion? I bought ivitf stock at an average of 1.39 as a long term holding. At least until January as these stocks are very seasonal. I may hold for years. Am I completely screwed on this stock?
18:36 amalia: No, KyleTrader.
18:37 KyleTrader: I was looking historically it has always bounced but I was a little nervous. @amalia
18:40 Trade_Options: KyleTrader-  It's a bit below LT support but based on the candles, MM might be taking out stops.   Just know when you're exiting.  
18:41 RandomDan: 
18:42 KyleTrader: Ok. Thank you so much it won’t be the end of the world if I lose the money but I just wanted a second opinion. I think it will bounce but sometimes it gets in your head when your down every day. I appreciate your analysis. @trade_options.
18:43 amalia: You're welcome.
18:43 RandomDan: BTW I just had a UI thought. Colors should not be just green or red, should gradually shift from deep red, to red, to orange, light orange, gray, pale green, green, deep green
18:43 Trade_Options: Kyle-  No worries, that's what we're here for. . .
18:44 KyleTrader: Thank you so much everyone. I appreciate it. The mm could be trying to scare everyone out for sure. I’ve held strong and averaged down through the beating. I have a 1.39 average with a hold time of 6 months to many years.
18:45 RandomDan: One thing tgat irks me is that the colors kind of change your mood, but not in an accurate way. If everything is down just a little, your screen goes all red. That's not right.
18:45 Trade_Options: Kyle-  It's always good to have a spec play. . . best of luck.
18:46 Trade_Options: Random-  Maybe you need to get a different shade of glasses.
18:46 amalia: Laters
18:46 ameriman: Kyle my sincere advice to you will be to avoid trading penny stocks
18:46 KyleTrader: Thanks a lot. Kinda like owning regn in the day. I knew over time there would probably be 50 percent drops and rises. Marijuana plays are always volatile.
18:47 Trade_Options: gn amalia
18:47 KyleTrader: I’ve always bought a variety of different things. This is my spec play. It may win it may lose but I’ll fight to trade another day. @ameriman.
18:49 FunPilot: Evening all.
18:49 ameriman: Kyle why even trade something that has huge edge against you? Thousands of better opportunities out there
18:50 tmoney20g: HMNY ?
18:50 FunPilot: Anyone know the best way to to search asset classes and sub classes like, Domestic, Internation, Fixed Income, Equity and such?
18:51 Trade_Options: ameriman-  You are 100% correct, but everyone has their own agenda.  
18:52 Trade_Options: Trading is as individual as the person.   That's what I like about it.
18:53 FunPilot: That is SO true
18:53 KyleTrader: Right. I figured that taking a risk on something like this early on would be no riskier than investing in alcohol during prohibition. If I’m wrong I lose the money life goes on, if I’m right the amount to be made could be huge.
18:56 tmoney20g: half my family was bootleggers, the other half were federal agents
18:56 tmoney20g: go figure
18:56 Trade_Options: Kyle-  When I trade options (long), I enter the trade fully expecting to lose all my $$.  That's the spec, so you need to have that thought nailed down.  It's just when you stay with that one play, then you'll get into trouble.
18:57 KyleTrader: Trouble? @trade_options
18:57 Trade_Options: Or style, ie penny plays.  You'll need to grow & learn from your trades.
18:58 Trade_Options: Trouble, as in defining winning only with penny stocks.   I have at least one in every account as a reminder of my bad decisions.  Thats all.
18:59 KyleTrader: Understood.
19:00 Trade_Options: brb.  Cats hungry.
19:00 KyleTrader: Thank you so much!
19:02 Trade_Options: NP Kyle.  I've been tradng a long time.  Made a lot of money and lost a lot of money.  Best thing is I'm better off than when I started because of higher net worth and learning along the way.   
19:02 Trade_Options: brb
19:02 tmoney20g: i'm winning megabillions tonight, so tomorrow should be fun
19:08 cajun: tmoney, i am too tonite.  
19:08 Trade_Options: yeah me too.  Got my 12 sets of number, gotta be a winner in there somewhere = ]
19:09 FunPilot: Shoot I wish I was.  It is ladies night out so the wife gets all the fun tonight.
19:09 cajun: ;-))
19:14 Trade_Options: When's the drawing?  After the evening news?
19:14 tmoney20g: 11pm est
19:15 Trade_Options: Ok so at the end of the late news.
19:15 tmoney20g: depending where you are, sure
19:16 Trade_Options: I'm CST but same difference.
19:16 Trade_Options: I normally don
19:16 tmoney20g: i personally give no chits, i'll check mine in like a month
19:16 Trade_Options: 't buy tickets but the odds are favorable for a winner
19:16 tmoney20g: unless they say "there's a missing ticket for the winner from Ventnor Wawa"
19:16 tmoney20g: then it *could* be me
19:17 tmoney20g: i can't believe how flat NQ is
19:18 Trade_Options: Ah the "WaWa."    
19:18 tmoney20g: well, until 15 minutes ago anyway
19:18 tmoney20g: too bad they're not publicly traded
19:18 tmoney20g: i'd def buy in
19:20 Trade_Options: My gal is from NJ, she intoduced me on our last trip to the coast.  Very suprised at the "cult" mindset regarding wawa.
19:20 Trade_Options: I'd agree with you on the buy in.   
19:28 tmoney20g: very cult
19:28 tmoney20g: like the highest daily loyalty of any sort of store on the plane
19:28 tmoney20g: planet
19:29 tmoney20g: like you might go to mcd's for bfast on saturday
19:29 tmoney20g: or you might order pizza every friday night
19:29 tmoney20g: but EVERY MORNING you go to wawa
19:31 tmoney20g: where in nj she from ?
19:33 Trade_Options: Cherry Hill area
19:37 tmoney20g: i'm near there
19:37 tmoney20g: halfway between philly and ac
19:37 tmoney20g: i work in ac
19:39 Trade_Options: Camdon, forgot CH was where we stayed.  Home of Subaru USA (big fan)
19:40 Trade_Options: Watched Board Walk so had to see AC. . . 
19:43 tmoney20g: boardwalk empire ?
19:43 tmoney20g: so earlier when i said half my family was bootleggers, and the other half was federal agents
19:43 tmoney20g: my grandmother's brother was the us marshall that arrested nucky

06:31 blondetrader: I have 67.4 so we r spot on
06:32 blondetrader: based on yest close which was a confluence of weekly and monthly....if the low was any good price should test 68.6ish at some point in next day or 3
06:32 invertedhammer: Missed long fill at 66.4 earlier so not chasing

07:07 featherweight: Woof got out of GCs in time
07:10 efu: es  no look good
07:13 Jonchew38: Dow futures pointing to a positive open - probably on back of BA earnings beat. But will the broader market be lifted up?
07:14 efu: senior, senior, your britches are tore, you better go home and get you some more , senior
07:14 blondetrader: based on dly momo we should have another day-2 sideways to down
07:14 blondetrader: but that is not to say momo HAS to complete the cycle so for es :52 is key
07:15 radon224: I predict 2 days of staring at the screen saying "WTF??"
07:15 blondetrader: any close over 58 suggests that for now bottom in

07:17 blondetrader: or splat
07:17 Jonchew38: the narrative from companies when they do the reporting would be impt
07:18 Jonchew38: in guiding expectations going forward
07:18 blondetrader: yep
07:18 blondetrader: gc as mentioned yesterday has a compelling sell up around 50-55
07:18 blondetrader: if the support holds that would be the next get
07:19 Jonchew38: i am bearish - think fed may be behind the curve - if tariff results in higher costs down the road... fed may be forced to hike more

08:04 tmoney20g: for the most efficient trading, yes
08:04 tmoney20g: multiple windows, larger charts, etc

08:46 tmoney20g: seems like it
08:46 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: lol
08:46 tmoney20g: waiting for lows around 1030-11
08:46 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: that was an interesting V bottom reversal  yesterday!
08:47 tmoney20g: problem is, there's no reason to bounce off a bottom right now
08:47 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: straight up off a low, with no daily retest!
08:47 tmoney20g: what dreams are made of
08:47 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: lol
08:48 stockhawk: CWST IN @ 31.08
08:49 stockhawk: tsla bearish 3 rd lower high from seemed like a fake triple bottom
08:49 tmoney20g: 7080 test coming
08:49 tmoney20g: think it'll break right thru
17:21 amalia: The manual is a great start.
17:24 daybuck: Im sure it probably would be for someone that knows how to code but I cant even translate the code I want converted
17:31 amalia: If it's making you money, it's a worthy endeavor to start learning.
17:31 amalia: Else contact someone outside of the chatroom by other means than soliticing in here and pay them to do it for you.
17:32 daybuck: TDA told me this was the place to ask for help
17:36 amalia: You may have better luck coming back tomorrow during regular trading hours and see if anyone wants to help you. Converting is above my paygrade. What's the study? It's probably already in thinkScript.
17:38 daybuck: This is the script...It is pivot points on different timeframes
17:38 amalia: Don't paste it!
17:39 amalia: Stop!
17:39 amalia: Confirm please
17:39 amalia: daybuck!!!
17:39 daybuck: yes
17:39 amalia: Before we get to anything about code or sharing anything...
17:39 amalia: What's it called?
17:39 amalia: What's it do?
17:41 daybuck: As I said before, it is pivot points on different time frames. I dont know what else to tell you
17:43 MTS1: how are the pivots detemined?  I assme you looked at the built-in ones? 
17:44 amalia: daybuck?
17:45 daybuck: yes
17:46 amalia: Can you answer some of the questions we've provided?
17:46 amalia: daybuck, keep up or else we're moving on.
17:49 daybuck: amalia, I have answered the best I know to answer. I don't code so maybe your questions are over my head. I came here for help and nobody has even asked to see the code. Maybe if you look at it you can answer your own questions, unfortunately, I can't
17:50 daybuck: MTS1, the built in ones move on a daily basis. This code doesn't move on a daily timeframe
17:50 MTS1: So what timeframe does it move on?
17:50 amalia: See? There's one answer.
17:51 daybuck: Monthly and weekly
17:51 amalia: Don't limit yourself. You must be able to describe what you trade. We can start by the name...
17:52 MTS1: Most of the built-in ones have settings for that.
17:53 MTS1: Do you know how your script calculates the pivots? Is it using a standard method like the built-in ones or something special?
17:53 daybuck: amalia, explain your question...what do I trade. Not sure what difference it makes
17:54 MTS1: Amalia must have had a bad day; we'd like people to stick around and answer clarification questions and be as specific as they can be.
17:54 amalia: I'm here inquiring and asking questions. I must not care. lol
17:54 daybuck: Guys, don't ask me questions about the script. I cant explain it. Seems it would be much simpler to look at it.
17:54 amalia: daybuck, coders are anal. My bad if you're reading tension through text. Far from the truth.
17:54 amalia: Go ahead then.
17:55 MTS1: OK DayBreak; take a step back then: If you're trading using pivots that you don't understand you may want to revisit your trading plan?
17:55 amalia: There's the disconnect for me. "...don't ask me questions about the script. I can't explain it"
All I hear is, "I don't know how to use this study I want converted."
17:56 amalia: I'm just telling you my thought process. Don't take it personal.
17:56 daybuck: I know how to trade it on another platform but would rather have it on TOS. It just that simple
17:57 amalia: Share the script, daybuck.
17:57 MTS1: you should understand the logic behind the pivots or where they are derived / calculated from; I assume they are not random lines to you. My guess is the built-in ones do what you want already or can be a start, unless you can explain / show how your pivots are calculated differently.
17:58 mcdon0301: hi.  i put a moonphase script together( I know hocus pocus), but having issues. would anyone care to take a look? http://tos.mx/rQvJJd#
17:59 amalia: mcdon0301, here you go
http://tos.mx/J2Xh4V#
17:59 MTS1: There are at least 4 built-in pivot scripts that have slight variations how they are calculated, that all have inputs for day, week, month, or more.
18:00 daybuck: I cant even get it to paste up
18:01 amalia: daybuck, please exit and re-enter the room.
18:01 amalia: daybuck, go to pastebin.com and after you've loaded the code there, share the link here.
18:01 daybuck: ok
18:03 mcdon0301: that was fast.
18:03 MTS1: Suspect it is not the same script if you created one from scratch;)
18:04 MTS1: you can expect moonphase scripts to have issues before a full moon though; may not be your script;)
18:04 amalia: Did you even look at it? lol
18:04 amalia: nvm
18:05 amalia: -_-
18:05 mcdon0301: yes, trying to take a look
18:06 MTS1: I know Alpha has one too; ask him next time he's arround. He's proud off that one!
18:09 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current but for the gap from the open until 8:56am.  Dinner bell''s ringing.  Later gators...
18:14 amalia: Room, I need help as well...
18:15 amalia: I've made a MinRange for Intraday, Weekly and Monthly. Now trying to come up with a Yearly one. This one's mainly for coding practice but seem to be stuck
18:20 FunPilot: Afternoon all.  Crazy day in the market.
18:20 FunPilot: But a decent ending.
18:21 MTS1: What's the problem Amalia?
18:22 MTS1: Fun; that was NOT a fun ending for me. .
18:23 daybuck: amalia, hope this works :https://pastebin.com/RNx5vcWG
18:24 FunPilot: Sorry man.  I lost too, just not as much.  Just trying to look at the positive.
18:26 amalia: MTS1, looking through daybuck's link, looks like a HL3 on MTF?
18:26 amalia: Ok, going back to where I'm stuck...
18:27 amalia: daybuck, the code you shared, is there an author?
18:28 daybuck: I hope that wasn't a trick question....!
18:29 amalia: Someone wrote the script. Characters and syntax didn't just appead. Do you know who did?
18:29 daybuck: Im sure there is but its thru a 3rd party and Im not sure who wrote it. Sorry
18:29 amalia: Ah.
18:29 amalia: It's bad juju to share a script with no author.
18:29 amalia: Most here wouldn't touch it without it. Could be copyrighted, etc.
18:29 MTS1: DayBuck; so looks like standard pivot levels, no extensions? Is the 'special' thing the coloring based on SMA crossover?
18:30 FunPilot: If I may ask a dumb question, is there an easy stock screener on Thinkorswim to find asset classes and sub classes like Market Cap, Domestic, International, Fixed Income, Equity.
18:30 daybuck: All I know is JJ. Sorry
18:33 daybuck: From what I know, the only thing special is the pivot levels remain the same whereas the boxed ones on TOS move daily depending on the market. Reminds me somewhat of Darvas Boxes but......
18:34 MTS1: They do not; I already told you multiple times that you can change the input to not change daily
18:35 daybuck: They do not what MTS1?
18:35 MTS1: change every day if you don't want them to; they have inputs for the periods you wanted.
18:36 MTS1: (just like the script you shared)
18:37 daybuck: ok. Great. Now were getting somewhere. Back to my original proclamation. I dont code. So how do I mirror this script with the boxed one on TOS?
18:37 MTS1: have not seen one for periods less than day though; but does not sound like you were looking for the 8 hour pivot option.
18:40 daybuck: The idea is to trade off of an hourly chart at or near the monthly pivit (assuming some other criteria is met)
18:40 daybuck: Pivot
18:42 MTS1: Seriously Day; been saying that starting with my first responses. This has nothing to do with coding. Check out the built-in ones, read the tutorials at tlc.thinkorswim.com to get familiar with TOS, and ask support for a platform tour. Make sure you have 10 questions ready for them so they can show you the platform inside out.
18:47 daybuck: i had a platform tour 5 years ago when I started using TOS. I just never coded anything so I cant tell where the boxed one is different from what I wanted coded. All I know is that the two are different. The pivots are not the same as they are on the other platform
18:48 MTS1: When you set them to weekly or monthly they are not the same?
18:49 MTS1: Which ones did you try?
18:50 amalia: daybuck, if I can explain the whole situation here today is like going to McDonald's and giving the cashier a wet paper where the order was written in and not being able to give some sort of idea of what was originally there and expecting the cashier to be a sort of mind-reader. There's going to be a disconnect here until you can provide us with the author, link to the study/strategy with parameters/data, etc.
18:51 daybuck: Honestly, I havent tried personally. The fellow I got the code from told me when I asked that it didn't match the other platform because of the movement. He uses it on another platform. I would rather use TOS so I'm trying to convert it
18:52 daybuck: He used to use TOS
18:53 MTS1: Right when we started this whole (long) conversation you said you tried the built-in ones and that they changed daily, and I told you the built-in ones have settings for weekly and monthly when you said that's what you needed. We're full back now; why don't you try the built-in ones and see what you find.
18:54 sebastian2363: Hey, sorta new to the system here - I was wondering if any of you guys got EarningsPerShareTTM() to work. I can't even get it to plot.
18:54 amalia: 1h:35m of talking with daybuck. I tap out. GL daybuck.
18:54 amalia: Welcome sebastian2363.
18:54 daybuck: No problem. What do I change in the built in code to keep them from moving daily?
18:55 amalia: I was about to reply. lol No!
18:55 amalia: sebastian, did you try different tickers?
18:55 sebastian2363: I tried the default and "v".
18:55 MTS1: they'll give you a platform tour for free every 6 months
18:57 daybuck: This would have been much simpler if you could just not respond or admit you dont know how to answer the question
18:58 MTS1: I don't see EarningsPerShareTTM()?
18:59 sebastian2363: Its under the new "stock fundamentals" tab
18:59 MTS1: Oh; not a script?
19:00 sebastian2363: It is a script function
19:01 MTS1: daybuck; really/??? I know the answer, and so should you, we discussed them right in the beginning. It would have been much easier if you just were listening and honest / trying from the start.
19:03 MTS1: It does not seem like you've actually used TOS in the past 5 years and don't know how to add a built-in indicator? Do you know how to add a MA and change the settings? This is not a coding issue, this is PEBKAC.
19:04 amalia: I indulged you for more than a hour. MTS1 also concluded that we've gone full circle but you keep thinking otherwise. Here I am still replying back giving you the benefit of the doubt that you can somehow recover.
19:04 amalia: +1 MTS1
19:06 amalia: btw here are some of your pivots
def MonPivot = HL3(period = AggregationPeriod.MONTH);
def WeekPivot = HL3(period = AggregationPeriod.WEEK);
19:07 MTS1: Sebastian; have not played with those yet, but I'd try some different tickers.
19:07 amalia: daybuck has left the room. lol
19:08 amalia: "No one else can be right" attitude even when asking for help. smh -_-
19:09 sebastian2363: ok. thank you let me try
19:10 amalia: Room, what's a good way to collect Yearly OHLC values?
19:10 MTS1: But my indicator is special; I want it coded from scratch even if it already exists and I don't know what it does;)
19:11 MTS1: Amalia; O/C should be easy based on year change; would you want to use secondary aggregation for H/L or are you trying to keep it scanner friendly?
19:12 MTS1: H/L could be done that way also I guess based on year change; how many years back do you need though?
19:12 MTS1: Amalia; still there??? ;)
19:13 amalia: Yeah, going back and forth from Editor, chart then back here.
19:13 amalia: Funny link but this is what I have so far:
http://tos.mx/SedWed#
19:13 amalia: SedWed. lmao
19:17 MTS1: Not sure why yo have the extra if-then loop in there instead of 
def YearL = if YearChange==1 then L else if L<=YearL[1] then L else  YearL[1] ;
19:18 MTS1: but that's one way. Was thinking you wanted prior year OHLC which you could then carry forward. Or was thinking using monthly aggregation and getting highest, but this is easier.
19:19 amalia: I'm open to ideas really.
19:19 MTS1: (And the close obviously is the prior year's close).
19:19 MTS1: How are you using the values; how far back do you need OHLC, just prior year or current year?
19:20 amalia: This is what I'm trying to calculate:
def yearMinRange = Average(if YearC>=YearO then Min(YearH-YearC,YearO-YearL) else Min(YearH-YearO,YearC-YearL),10);
19:20 amalia: So I can't use Highest/Lowest cause that uses a rolling period
19:24 MTS1: are those current year values?
19:24 amalia: The ones in the label, yes.
19:24 MTS1: no hte yearMinRange def
19:24 MTS1: *the
19:25 amalia: Yes.
19:26 amalia: It's gonna be current until it's BNd I think
19:26 MTS1: Then you've got it already, except use the current close instead of tye Y one as that's last year's close.
19:27 amalia: But I'm trying to get last year's H/L. I can't use current values for calculation
19:27 fibfibfib: hey amalia, I just open your work on the yearly and it looks cool. Just a though, is it possible to include the open and closing price for yearly, monthly, quartley, weekly and daily?
19:27 MTS1: That's what I was asking;)
19:28 amalia: fibfibfib, it looks cool but it's not done yet. Will share when it's done.
19:28 fibfibfib: and on each line, add a bubble to say year open, year close...etc
19:29 MTS1: Then carry forward def PYH = if YearChange==1 then  YearO[1] else PYH[1]; ? 
19:29 MTS1: Sorry PYO in this case - PriorYearOpen; same for H/L
19:29 fibfibfib: thanks Amalia, MTS1.. im just beginning to learn so not as expert as you guys
19:30 fibfibfib: but so far, that's a very good idea to start on.
19:30 MTS1: WE NEED MORE BUBBLE (in SNL CowBell Voice)
19:32 amalia: lol
19:32 MTS1: Is that what you need Amalia, or am I missing something still?
19:33 amalia: Getting off desktop. that useless chat earlier fried my brain. gonna go get my green remedy on to get some cells back to attack this iead head on with more patience. =) MTS1, thanks for indulging
19:34 MTS1: lol, gn
19:34 amalia: =)
19:38 fibfibfib: don't go too long now, we need your brainpower. hahahaha
19:39 fibfibfib: just kidding

07:46 Mobius: http://tlc.thinkorswim.com/center/reference/thinkScript/Functions/Look---Feel/AddCloud.html
07:46 JohnnyQuotron: Good morning thinkScript Lounge.  I notice that no one has lost their sense of humor.  Excellent!
07:48 Mobius: Got over a 1% globex range on high volume with price near previous close again. Whats NOT to be excited about?
07:53 LAZY: I just copied and printed out thinkscript.  Why Wally siad it is useless in word??
07:54 LAZY: I like to meet gofast :)
07:55 eayjee: mobius, is it hard to put those parameters in a script?  the instruction page wasn't too clear
07:56 eayjee: don't mean to bother and I appreciate any help
07:58 Vimes: not sure you tried very hard: see if this works
def ema26 = expaverage(close,26);
def ema9h = expaverage(high,9)[3];
def ema9l = expaverage(low,9)[3];
addcloud(ema9h,ema26,color.green,color.yellow);
addcloud(ema26,ema9l,color.red,color.yellow);
07:59 eayjee: really appreciate that Vimes, thank you both
08:01 eayjee: that worked perfectly....thanks a lot
08:19 dokk408: anyone know if there's a way to get the implied volatility of an ATM call on the Friday following earnings?
08:20 Mobius: there's no history for series IV
08:21 dokk408: ok, thnx
08:21 Vimes: do you mean the next series?
08:21 Sorkin: Oct 29 GE $12 puts
08:22 dokk408: im trying to track the expansion of IV as earnings approaches
08:22 Vimes: Well mobius read your mind then, no history
08:24 Vimes: You could maybe estimate it from teh ImpVolatility() plot but i'm out of my element there
08:25 tarbog: hey dmonkey.  thanks for the script on day mid.  i got it on my charts yesterday and it worked well for the day session.  thanks.  really appreciate your help.
08:26 dokk408: the ImpVolatility appears to give an aggregation of several expirations
08:44 Mobius: dokk.. There's no need to guess. All the data and method for calculating IV is listed on the CBOE in a white paper.
08:45 BenP: Good Morning.  I have squeezed an intraday chart down so small that I lost the 'Time' displayed in the X axis.  Is there any code available to deliniate the change of each day with a vertical line?
08:46 Mobius: yes
08:47 dokk408: thnx Mobius.  now i just have to learn enough so i can create a script for it so display on my charts!
08:48 Mobius: dokk.. You don't need to learn to calculate it TOS has functions to display annualized IV and all the various series IV already
08:56 willie_sutton: gm all
08:56 BenP: Hi Mobius.  Was that 'yes' for me?
08:59 MTS1: Yes
08:59 MTS1: Look at AddVerticalLine() function
08:59 MTS1: or just put vertical in the left-top filter box in the reference
08:59 MTS1: (to find available functions)
09:02 MTS1: next you'll probably look in the date/time section to find the function to determine if the day changed to use in the vertical line function.
09:04 BenP: gotcha.  thanks !!
09:04 MTS1: yw
09:10 Paris: BenP - Here's an example on plotting a vertical line
# Vertical Line on New Day
# 9.17.2018
def today = getDay() == getLastDay();
addVerticalLine(today and !Today[1], "New Day", color.cyan, curve.short_dash);
09:11 Vimes: i wonder how many total mobius snippets are out there, 1000, 2000?  :) :)
09:12 Paris: I must have at least 500+ snort snippets
09:12 fibfibfib: Hi Mobius, if there a way to automatically fib measure the prior week and month?
09:12 Mobius: fibfib.. yes
09:12 fibfibfib: or does anyone know how?
09:15 Mobius: you already have the Auto Fib Study. Just change the iData to whatever higher aggregation you want
09:17 Paris: whoops, typo: snort = short. LOL!
09:17 willie_sutton: anyone found a way to plot option delta for mulpiple strikes on a lower?
09:18 Vimes: lol, didn't notice
09:18 Mobius: I prefer snort Paris... Fits me better  :)
09:18 Paris: Heh!
09:18 Vimes: a snort of jd
09:20 Mobius: willie.. that could be done as long as you don't try to  get much more than 1 or 2 strikes away from ATM
09:20 willie_sutton: Hi Mobius - that woud be fine with me
09:21 willie_sutton: I hope you're well
09:21 Mobius: then use the Options Dashboard or any of the other studies I've written for a template to get the OPRA symbols. From there you can calculate delta or get it from TOS data
09:22 Mobius: /ES is giving me that sinking feeling
09:23 Vimes: buyers just can't get it done
09:24 Mobius: looks like pros selling into any rally. Volume goes down on a rise and way up on a fall. Energy is on the down side.
09:26 Mobius: Now a days that could change in a minute. Used to be, at the first sign of energy higher going down it was a clear sign to go to a higher cash weighting or to hedge tight. Now it's just not so clearcut.
09:27 Vimes: interesting

09:28 Vimes: i think the chemical market has become so savy on passing on formula pricing based on raws perhaps in the old days they weren't as clver
09:28 Vimes: clever
09:28 mthfr_vaxxed: Any reasons you know of why October is so gloomy usually? Black Thursday from 1929 still scaring everyone? or something else?
09:30 Mobius: mth.. There's 100 opinions about that if there's 1. Best source in my opnion is Traders Almanac
09:30 willie_sutton: I should say that I've been looking at your option dashboard as well, but I'm not sure how it works.  I'm slow as you know.  I understand that you calculated an approximate delta, but i'm unsure how that would be applied across multiple strikes.  I'll keep at it.
09:31 Vimes: externals might not stick - but a site that allows a quick view of seasonal trends
http://marketqview.com/seasonalchart.php?ID=75
09:33 Vimes: would suggest october is actually historically strong into eoy
09:41 MTS1: Willie; it would be cool if you left headers / attribution / comments in the code.
09:42 MTS1: and give it a name
09:44 willie_sutton: agreed
09:45 willie_sutton: Call it:
#it plots the bid and ask of a manually entered option.
09:47 cajun: willie, building on MTS, how bout specifying what you changed/added to mobius work
09:48 willie_sutton: apologies to all
09:50 Paris: MTS - I've annotated Willie's suggested nomenclature on my end. All good on my end
09:50 MTS1: Appreciate the sharing! Just feedback as I didn' see headers or what it does or attribution to original code / enhancements. I see you left comments in further down, but a header would be nice.
09:52 willie_sutton: all the attributions were mobius'
09:53 kjg: Hello - can anyone tell me how to add a chart to show a study only.  don't need price..
09:54 Vimes: somewhere in settings hide price
09:55 MTS1: There's a function also to do it in a script; just searched for hide in the reference; hidePricePlot()
09:57 Paris: Willie, since your posted study plots the bid/ask of a manually entered option, I have tagged your study with the following header in my archives as a placeholder.
# Bid and Ask OPRA Code
# willie_sutton
# 10.24.2018
09:57 willie_sutton: i love that
09:57 Paris: Thanks for your contribution Willie!
09:58 kjg: Vimes, MTS1 - thank you - I'll check it out
10:00 willie_sutton: I must admit that i didn't fuly understand Mobius' cloud shading; so you can add this if you like:
# for addCloud, green denotes when someone hits the ask price, red denotes hitting the bid
10:01 Paris: Noted
10:06 JohnnyQuotron: Willie... like Paris I will be adding a header to the mobius script you altered.  Please, where ever possible add an authorship header to your scripts and if you are adjusting someone else's code comments regarding the changes are particularly helpful.  Mobius code is considered the "Gold Standard" and relied upon without hesitation..  if you are adjusting his code, particularly his logic or math, it is critical that those looking at your script next week or next year know where it deviated from the "Gold Standard".  Thank you.
10:17 DMonkey: gm.....

10:17 JohnnyQuotron: Morning D
10:18 willie_sutton: Sorry johnny, I'm new here
10:20 Nube: Traders Almanac is a great book to the get the hamster wheel spinning.
10:30 JohnnyQuotron: willie... no need to be sorry.  I apologize if I came of as being gruff.  I'm glad you're here and contributing.  I'm just thinking about a Community OneNote reader looking at your script six months from now.  If you haven't visited the Community OneNote here is the public link    https://1drv.ms/u/s!AnkeHrrRM_cvgxQTl1xckINYlKhZ
10:32 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current.  BBL
10:32 Mobius: DMonkey - Love your naming convention in that study. So creative  :)
10:36 JohnnyQuotron: Mobius... imagine Limbo Bars using that naming convention xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

11:18 Steve: I'm new; how do I add a 200 day moving average to a chart?
11:19 Farmin: click on the studies button, then add study then find 'SimpleMovingAverage'
11:21 amalia: Steve, after clicking on the studies button then adding "SimpleMovingAverage", I would contact support@thinkorswim.com and ask for a platform tour. They're pretty good at answering all your questions. Welcome to TDA.
11:22 Steve: I can find Moving Averages, but not SimpleMovingAverage
11:23 amalia: Stick to the ones you can find then.
11:24 Steve: i found simpel moving agevage
11:25 amalia: Great.
11:25 Steve: I think thats it; do I have to do anything to change it to 200 or does it come that way
11:25 amalia: There's inputs you can change if it's not 200
11:27 Steve: ok; i have it; thanks
11:28 Farmin: this link may help in your education - http://tlc.thinkorswim.com/center/howToTos.html
11:55 Doogy_Chump: hi everyone, has anyone a version of Mobius " Stochastic Normalized to Price" that works in an alert (in TOS charts)????
12:00 MTS1: the alert function should work
12:06 Doogy_Chump: I get different erro signs, depending on which version, like this is one; " Error processing referenced script Stoch_Normalized_to_Price_WithMAcross: No such function: HighestAll at 1:33
Expected double
Expected interface com.devexperts.tos.thinkscript.data.IDataHolder at 1:19"
12:07 MTS1: sounds like you're trying to reference the study in a MarketWatch alert; not TOS Charts
12:07 amalia: What's the script you modified?
12:07 amalia: Ah
12:08 Doogy_Chump: 
Stochastic_Normalized_to_Price
# Stochastic Normalized to Price With no Fibonacci Lines
# Client Request
# 11.21.2013
12:13 FrankB3: Mr. Mo:  Like your RSI_Laguerre, but would it defeat the purpose of the RSI, if the FE line crosses the RSI for a better read ???  I know Doc S. does not use the indicator that way,, but I like simple reads ???    http://tos.mx/V2qr6t#
12:15 MTS1: Frank; as I understand those are separate signals; the RSI crossing oversold/bought may be a signal, but not it crossing FE. FE has it's own, separate, meaning.
12:17 FrankB3:  Yep,, I never get it right:  do you think it could give a more definite read ???
12:18 MTS1: Doogy; is that from his MyTrade? Not sure about the script without seeing it; but you can add an alert function in the script to run it on your charts with alerts if that's what you need. Otherwise you can try setting it up as a scan - dynamic watchlist and set alerts on that. The MW alerts are more restrictive on what is allowed code wise. Not sure which one you're attempting based on your error sounded like it was not charts.
12:18 Nube: That indicator is fast enough that you could use FE as the singla line
12:19 MTS1: right, just as crossing the middle, but that was not the purpose of FE, then you're just using it as a random crossing line.
12:20 Nube: A bar or two later getting in or out and less chop probably wash each other out.
12:21 Nube: Correct about that, MTS. Not the purpose, just happens to be fast enough that it likely won't kill the results.
12:22 Doogy_Chump: Thanks, MTS1 and others. Its TOS charts, where I right click and choose the creeate alert dialog box. I think i will strip it down to the bear minimun and see if I can get that to work?
12:24 MTS1: Frank; I have mine set to color white when it starts turning in OS/OB area, green when going up or maxed out (typically from OS), red when going down. It typically does not spend much time in the 'middle'. between os/ob, and the white gives you a head start to pay attention.
12:26 MTS1: Doogy; that creates a MW alert. Manual has restrictions listed; like no recursion. If script has that will probably be hard to change. Try the alert function first if that works for you; but that one only works in TOS and no eml/sms
12:34 Mobius: Who was it that said yesterday was pretty bullish. Welcome to a volatile two sided market
12:36 Mobius: As regards RSI Laguerre with FE. The FE in that study adjusts RSI length. There's no correlation to RSI and FE. RSI is the momentum signal. FE only shows trending or not trending and doesn't show whether the trend is up or down, strong or weak.
12:36 FrankB3:  Nube/ MTS  : Well thanks for your imput,,,  Watched Doc S. seminar on FE every month,,, will get it some day.  
12:36 Mobius: I wrote that study long before Doc ever saw it.
12:40 MTS1: Doc is doing his own thing again FYI Frank
12:41 FrankB3: Doc it a great teacher, learned how to do weekly credit spreads from him

12:43 MTS1: Thanks Mobius!
12:44 Mobius: I don't think Doc was a good fit with DK and gang. He's far too low key
12:46 MTS1: Doc is good teaching yes, but still sometimes confusing or hard to execute rules. I'm still lost as far as FE is concerned as far as actionable w proven consistency. I may not have the right settings or look at it correctly still; even after reviewing script notes or watching Doc.
12:46 MTS1: thought they liked low key / calmnes, during trading anyway.
12:46 Mobius: Doc has a nice thoughtful approach to options trading. Spread risk with many smaller trades. Be patient and go for the long haul with a reasonable approach to making an income
12:47 Mobius: FE is NOT a trading signal. It never was and never will be.
12:47 MTS1: Sounds similar to DK to me? Though Doc more based on TA and DK more based on stats / extremes.
12:49 Mobius: DK doesn't fit into any catagory of typical trader.
12:49 Mobius: He's just DK. In his own DK world  :)
12:50 MTS1: Maybe because of Doc vids took FE as trending indicator; when high there's energy left for trend to continue, and when low trend may be stopping and going to contractoin or even reverse. He was not execuring rsi signal if FE did not give go ahead that there'
12:50 MTS1: d be energy
12:51 Mobius: FE is really simple - High reading market flat and building energy. Low reading Market trending and expending energy. nothing more to it
12:54 FrankB3:    Thanks  Mr. Mo:: but a question on trade strategy:::  If a trader used a short term swing trade, say 3% profit or market on close on 3rd day:: could he make as much profit as long term holder of stocks, if his method had a high win rate???

12:36 tmoney20g: it'll ball up
12:36 radon224: the frame of reference is the bike, not the bystander....so the answer is yes
12:36 DrHouse: Guess AMD earnings are going to be stellar...
12:36 tmoney20g: and create so much energy it'l blow out the front tire

12:38 VolCrush: welp they wear bronw shorts
12:39 radon224: Imo, this up/down only gets worse running up to the elections
12:39 radon224: Confucius Say: Politician is one who hake your hand before elections, and your confidence after
12:39 lilFish: think it'll be more down than up, but just thinking out loud

15:09 PI: what do you all think of NSYS?
15:09 stockhawk: huge sell orders after market registering. Tomoorow will be ugly.
15:09 TnT: Part of this is the election, markets hate uncertainty
15:10 VolCrush: of course
15:10 chenmann: ^^
15:10 gerardom: no chance of the "C" Tomorrow

15:14 bobospy: rates increase slow every thing 
15:14 VolCrush: MSFT goin solo

15:20 VolCrush: just outside MMM re: TSLA
15:20 TnT: nice Dan
15:21 RandomDan: TnT no, it was obvious they would have earnings
15:22 VolCrush: one could get a short squeeze on TSLA
15:22 DrHouse: Whatever happened, I got out of my TSLA
15:22 TnT: ok, I don't trade stocks, so I don't really pay much attention, futures are easier
15:22 RandomDan: the shorts have been living in a parallel universe
15:22 DrHouse: TNT, futures can be mean tho
15:22 TnT: well yes, leverage is key
15:23 VolCrush: MSFT JUST inside MMM
15:24 gerardom: I'm swimming green on tsla
15:24 VolCrush: wee pop in AMZN with all of this malarky
15:25 DrHouse: Wish I didn’t back off the computer. Could have made another $5/share for tsla.

------- Friday, October 12, 2018 -------
15:23 VolCrush: so bronx, don't u owe us something?
15:23 RandomDan: I think the market is set to go sideways, newsflow dependent.
15:24 blondetrader: lol
15:24 blondetrader: we didnt open 2780 so I only owe it to u
15:25 AlphaInvestor: So, WFC which missed E is up 1.3% today ... but JPM that beat E is down 1.09% today. What kinda bizarro world do we live in.
15:26 VolCrush: ok, i'll wait patiently for the "ping" on my phone
any second now, right?
15:26 blondetrader: keep watching for it
15:26 JC_chart: cuirious on rty trade
15:26 RandomDan: It's my fault Al. Fins going up as soon as I take a loss on my GS.
15:26 JC_chart: mind sharing your entry and exit and chart timeframe
15:26 RandomDan: but I don't feel like doing that
15:26 VolCrush: welp you Alpha, more than anyone here know that funnies don't mean chit with respect to how the market reacts
ergo, drop funnies
LOL
15:27 JC_chart: totally ok if you say no... just interested

15:28 blondetrader: JC I am flat rn
15:28 blondetrader: this was not the day I expected
15:28 blondetrader: haha no
15:28 JC_chart: did you hold it thru last night?
15:28 blondetrader: I did
15:28 blondetrader: and got stopped out this am
15:28 JC_chart: holy s**
15:28 JC_chart: that's a big stop LOL
15:29 blondetrader: no lol I made $$
15:29 RandomDan: bt, really. This is exactly the day I expected... using your TA!
15:29 JC_chart: i am sure you did
15:29 JC_chart: u were short right
15:29 AlphaInvestor: Vol - with both reporting the same day, they should have reacted in relation to their E results
15:29 blondetrader: :)
15:29 JC_chart: as of yesterday afternoon
15:29 blondetrader: no i was long into this am
15:29 VolCrush: welp send me a pic wearing red soled only then...........
15:29 JC_chart: ohhh i thought you were short
15:29 VolCrush: Alpha, they did
15:29 JC_chart: it went up 25 points
15:29 blondetrader: nooo I was on for the rally pffft
15:29 blondetrader: I was looking for 95 lol
15:30 RandomDan: she was long, I remember
15:30 JC_chart: what tiemframe do you use to identify entries
15:30 blondetrader: 4 hr mostly
15:30 blondetrader: and dly
15:30 RandomDan: so what about the day didn't go as you expected?
15:30 blondetrader: well Dan I thought the pop would have more teeth
15:30 blondetrader: this was like a little kitten
15:30 blondetrader: not a lion
15:31 RandomDan: I thought it was pretty good, considering the wreckage.
15:31 blondetrader: I would not be surprised to see another wave of selling monday am b4 we get any consecutive days of green
15:31 blondetrader: dissapointing
15:32 blondetrader: but i have some scary tgts lower
15:32 RandomDan: the day was a big cup, also a positive.
15:32 blondetrader: so to avoid mkt need to do some work
15:32 VolCrush: not a bad pop actually, only because the close was vary gud on /nq
so respectfully disagree
15:32 blondetrader: nq could rally another 100
15:32 blondetrader: and still look like shit
15:32 VolCrush: or more
15:33 blondetrader: btw that would be res for leg 2
15:33 blondetrader: anything over........we good
15:33 VolCrush: well we wanna buy chit, who wants to buy gud?
15:33 blondetrader: lol yes but if nq fails that
15:33 blondetrader: you can buy it a lot cheaper
15:33 VolCrush: sell against
15:34 blondetrader: like to the tune of67s
15:34 VolCrush: true but we got pick our lines in der sand
15:34 blondetrader: figure 150 off this weeks low would be next tgt dn
15:34 blondetrader: well nq needs to hold 7112
15:34 VolCrush: i gots my names for hunting season and will fall on my sword if necessary
15:34 JC_chart: we could have some violent upswing no doubt in the indexes but I think insitutions need market to drop more so they can buy it and bid it back up like they do in every cycle
15:35 blondetrader: yes
15:35 AlphaInvestor: I think this past couple days was selling der MoMo and a rotation into Quality. MSFT, ADBE and such did very well for me when those trades were put in this week during the downturn
15:35 blondetrader: as i mentioned we have a htf bear move happening that isnt complete momo wise
15:35 blondetrader: and we have a dly oversold
15:35 VolCrush: heck i wanted 6845 on /nq, when i called 7 k /nq i got laffed out of here 
15:35 blondetrader: so would make sense to get some relif
15:35 JC_chart: yeah 6800 is the midpoint for nq for a 1Y daily chart
15:36 VolCrush: ah hah, ty @JC
15:36 JC_chart: honestly all that matters is AMZN
15:37 JC_chart: so we should just trade that as it makes up what percent of NQ ... 60 haha
15:37 VolCrush: emmmm, der fruit is a playa and mr softie is now relevant for some reason
15:37 blondetrader: 1835 needs to break amzn
15:37 blondetrader: orr 1621 lol
15:38 blondetrader: rty closed red today
15:38 blondetrader: no bueno
15:38 VolCrush: either way lots of resistance with every pop now
15:38 JC_chart: RTY is very sick on my chart
15:38 VolCrush: yah true dat, rty is a big problem atm
15:39 blondetrader: honesly
15:39 VolCrush: yes dear
15:39 blondetrader: if it has to rinse like to get it done this month
15:39 JC_chart: it trendline has been down since 9/24 and the pitch of that line is steep not much releif soon unless earning are rocking
15:39 blondetrader: like before last week of oct
15:39 VolCrush: welp u wanna see a down trend line go see XLF
15:40 blondetrader: it made a lower low today lol
15:40 JC_chart: youre right it is sicker
15:40 blondetrader: and it leads imo
15:40 blondetrader: this turned 1-2 weeks b4 the others gave it up
15:41 JC_chart: so any of you ever traded wheat futures or soybeans?
15:41 blondetrader: yep
15:42 JC_chart: you know they have nive moves in the morning
15:42 blondetrader: I do :)
15:42 Bid_Ask: what's nive
15:42 JC_chart: and they are super volatile but i was thinking i almost like them better than es
15:42 blondetrader: for sun night mon am i am really leaning on selling rty
15:42 JC_chart: you have the same payout
15:42 blondetrader: they offer minis
15:43 blondetrader: imo the trend is more true in ags
15:43 JC_chart: i was sitting in soybeans yesterday and forgot about the monthlyr eport and it ripped about 5 dollars in a nano second
15:43 blondetrader: yea got to mind those report
15:44 JC_chart: i was lucky i was long it also whipped back so i did fine but yes that was my thought exactly when i  sold the contracts LOL
15:44 blondetrader: lol
15:45 JC_chart: when you speak of trend you are speaking of trend on daily right?
15:45 blondetrader: genericly yes
15:45 blondetrader: but I prefer when all time frames are in agreement
15:46 JC_chart: me too ibut i try to just focus on one chart
15:46 JC_chart: i look at the daily 30m for trend
15:46 JC_chart: and then trade the 3 or 1m
15:46 blondetrader: oh yea thats too small for me
15:46 JC_chart: i built some indicaotrs that are multitimeframe so that helps just using one chart
15:46 fred__w: jc  i use 3 charts for context  1yr-mo 3mo-wk 14da-da
15:47 fred__w: and look for >11ema
15:47 JC_chart: im happy with a 10 tick move on cl or gc moer is great but i am greatful for that
15:47 JC_chart: im not an ema fan
15:47 fred__w: jc  i do that to build probability
15:48 JC_chart: but i get why you use it so please dont misunderstand my intent
15:48 fred__w: jc  the particular method is not criotical  i was giving you a variation of bt's stmt
15:49 blondetrader: :)

06:43 Tom: When I was on Prophet Charts last Thursday, Oct.11 the days CHARTS showed up well.  On Fri. Oct.12 (as has been the case 1-2 times per month) the chart for Thurs. was simply not there.  This has become an all too frequent occurance in 2017 &2018. Now, for the first time, the last 2 trading days are NOT showine up on Prophet Charts.  Many times I have contacted Technical Support.  I have asked them if it is "my computer or your" responsibility and have been told they "are aware of the problem."  Now, for the first time, the last 2 trading days are NOT showine up on Prophet Charts.  What is every one else out there doing about this problem?  I suspect this problem started to occur when TD Ameritrade took over.  In my communication with support personel I have been told there are other 'changes' coming.  Good Grief...Does anyone in the community have a solution...other than going to ScottTrade?
06:50 Bealzybub: Wish I could help. I cant even get answers about the "Marketwatch" trade trending lines.
06:51 Bealzybub: Which is really no problem. I'll get it figured out one way or the other. I'm making my 4% per day.
06:51 Tom: Do you have the same problem on Prophet Charts?
06:52 Bealzybub: I dont even know what that is. Which is the same answer I get when asking about "Marketwatch".
06:53 Bealzybub: I mean I've just been asking the community here and havent bothered tech @ Ameritrade.
07:00 Tom: TDAmer took over ThinkOrSwim, which as their trading platform, has the wonderful old Investools platform (if I have the history correct), but the Tech Support people have not been able to solve this problem.  They admit it is their issue and not my computer.  When the went over to Ameritrade we lost many of the research abilities and one, in particular, indicator...Virtual Volume (VV%).  All of the placating and "education support" they've offered have been ineffective in helping together with direct conversation.  I've moved funds and not placed funds with them because of their lack of genuine support.  This is the first time I've gone public and have asked for anyone with solutions to the problem and any similar experience(s).  
07:02 Tom: Is anyone else out there using the ThinkOrSwim, Prophet Charts platform for trading, research, etc?
07:06 Tom: It is still early in the morning to get suffiecient responses, but as I've turned on the ThinkOrSwim website & platform, I've noticed that the past 2 trading days (last Thurs. & Friday) charts are simply not there, even though I used them on their given days!
07:39 nora: Hi Tom.   TDam had announced last year that they were not going to support/upgrade Prophet charts any more.  In fact it was supposed to go away.  I have used and still am trying to use Prophet charts but recognze its limitation.  I am surprised that it is still functioning and available.  The Tos charts have lots of problems amd limitations also.
07:40 nora: My prophet charts have thurs and Friday.
07:40 MTS1: Tom; TDA 'took over' Thinkorswim ages ago, as well as prophet charts and more recently invest tools. ScottTrade was the most recent addition that they took over, but did not intergrate their platform. Prophetcharts has been slated for retirement for a while also, when supposedly all features are moved to TOS, but still left in for legacy users complaining when it was removed. I would not continue relying on prophet as a primary platform considering the priorities within TDA / TOS, and see if the TOS side is a better fit.
07:41 Nube: Prophet charts are no longer supported with any particular concern so I wouldn't expect to continue to work with them
07:41 MTS1: So you're too late to move to ScottTr;)
07:44 nora: The TOS charting had a really tough time last Wed and Thurs because of the high volume.  The charts froze for different lengths of time and lagged fro others.   
07:44 dellsystem: Whats going on with WTW  no Last 
07:50 nora: i have a premarket last... for WTW, 66.88 fwiw
07:51 dellsystem: Yes the  Feed is not updating  Think or Swim
08:01 dellsystem: Just updated
08:01 dellsystem: and now retracted
08:02 Tom: Where are the rest of you with your charts & research?  Where are the great trading platforms today?
08:03 AlphaInvestor: #TOSisBoss
08:04 Tom: Sorry Alpha...but read my paragraphs, above.  I used to think the same as you!
08:05 AlphaInvestor: Prophet is being sunsetted, suck it up and use TOS charts
08:05 AlphaInvestor: I can no longer get parts for my Edsel either
08:06 Tom: My complaints are about TOS...I HAVE TOS, and Prophet charts are what is displayed!
08:06 radon224: Alpha, I can give you a link for Edsel parts if you need it
08:06 AlphaInvestor: Prophet Charts = bye bye
08:06 Tom: How do I make the switch you describe?
08:07 Tom: I've been with InvestTools, TOS since 2007 but have received no notices for any type of switch that I can recall.
08:08 AlphaInvestor: There are two charting systems right now in thinkorswim a) TOS charts, b) Prophet Charts. Learn to use A, because B is going away
08:10 tmoney20g: will do big daddy Al
08:10 gerardom: sup tmoney
08:10 tmoney20g: o hi gerar
08:10 AlphaInvestor: As MTS1 mentioned, we were told that all Prophet functionality would be moved to TOS charts before it finally goes away
08:10 gerardom: gm man
08:10 tmoney20g: missed you on friday
08:10 tmoney20g: got my trailstop for options working
08:11 tmoney20g: just have to get used to it
08:11 tmoney20g: don't know why i didn't enable that 6 months ago
08:11 gerardom: nice! im going to test once out today
08:12 saint: where do i find level  2
08:12 gerardom: did u get into any positions from friday?
08:12 AlphaInvestor: Tmoney - as I mentioned last week, if you are using Stops with options... Then you don't understand options!!!
08:12 Tom: Alright...show me how to get to TOS charts. TOS is now what I use...but the chart display is still called/labeled "Prophet."  How do I enable it?  Tech Support has NOT suggested that in any of my communications with them.
08:13 Tom: When you converted were there any deletions of your current information, at the time?
08:13 tmoney20g: went 4/4 on friday
08:13 AlphaInvestor: TOS charts are to the left of Prophet Charts on the menu
08:14 Tom: I'll start there, Alpha.
08:15 radon224: RIP SHLD....no surprise
08:15 tmoney20g: never even heard of "prophet" charts
08:20 AlphaInvestor: Don't get me wrong, I love Prophet Charts
08:21 Nube: Tom, click the charts tab. Those aren't he ToS charts. Click the Prophet tab and you get the Prophet charts.
08:21 Vimes: I should maybe give them a second look, just confusing that they have two charting engines on the same platform
08:22 AlphaInvestor: That's why one is going away
08:22 tmoney20g: if they are going away, why even bother
08:22 tmoney20g: looking like buyers at the open ?
08:23 Nube: Prophet had the advantage of being able to do ratio charts in the ticket box and it had a better pattern finder but those are the only two advantages I ever found it to have. Had more historic data which could be meaningful depending on the user but ToS has mucho historic data now too
08:23 tmoney20g: what's your take on the econ data Al ?
08:24 AlphaInvestor: Pattern Finder in Prophet is da bee's knees
08:26 Scott_OT: Only 1 out of three computers I have TOS on shows a prophet tab.
08:27 tmoney20g: 2 minutes
08:27 AlphaInvestor: Tmoney - must have sold lotsa cars to get the combination of numbers released this morning
08:28 esmal: good morning all
08:28 tmoney20g: i was interested in the internet retail
08:28 tmoney20g: up 1.1% i think they said
08:28 tmoney20g: but amazon gapped down a little at 830
08:29 tmoney20g: what you eyeing esmal ?
08:29 Nube: My take on econ data is that we should outlaw collecting it so there charlatans of monetary experiment can't use it as an excuse to monkey around
08:29 AlphaInvestor: Internet retailing... It's just a fad
08:30 esmal: no clue lol
08:30 Nube: Amazon has had an epic couple of decades, it is allowed a small gap down
08:32 Tom: Thanks Nube, Nube & Alpha: The Vrtual Volume (VV%) in Prophet Charts was a wonderful tool for determining volume of the day vs volume of the past 90+ days...one look and you knew!  Anything like that on TOS, Alpha?
08:33 AlphaInvestor: Custom scripts exist to do virtual volume
08:33 Tom: Thanks, Vimes, as well!
08:35 radon224: Some goofball is calling for $400/bbl oil if the US sanctions Saudi Arabia.
08:42 AlphaInvestor: Bring it on - my portfolio is well positioned for that
08:44 fred__w: just went short
08:45 fred__w: lets ee what happens
08:46 AlphaInvestor: Some more bathwater being thrown out ... babies included
08:49 Eedie: Ok es bounced a little off the 200

08:50 Eedie: Hello alpha

08:59 tmoney20g: esmal, tried a call at that first bottom, kinda washed out
08:59 blondetrader: marcos
08:59 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: fred, sounds like u did research too. nasdaq did same action in 2000.  undercut 200 and then bounced, retrace 50% of losses over 3 months before dropping again.  but that was start of major bear.
08:59 mep1976: hey bt
08:59 esmal: yeah I had a bad call first run too
08:59 esmal: then i switched to puts and came up
09:00 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: check out thos 5m candles on gdx
09:00 gerardom: wild market today
09:01 tmoney20g: i'm switched, but not in yet
09:02 esmal: @darryl how you feeling on gdx? looks like its sideways at to me
09:03 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: dip, buy, dip, buy, dip, buy, dip, buy.......
09:03 blondetrader: es tgts lower -50 30 and 2698
09:05 fred__w: all in south  now
09:06 JT the Musician: feel like I should have shorted CRMD
09:06 esmal: so NFLX cancelled Iron Fist
09:08 Vimes: boo
09:09 Vimes: actually it was pretty bad
09:09 radon224: so we are below the 200DMA on SPX, by about 13 points
09:10 tanker: gm
09:10 cocodog: gm
09:12 tanker: cron 15 call @ .50 ?
09:15 featherweight: Qs not havin a good time
09:16 cocodog: qqq
09:17 blondetrader: 7040 immediate nq
09:23 Millionaire51: exel
09:24 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: AAPL threatening to break 50 day again.
09:24 invertedhammer: Ty bt 1531 rty
09:25 Millionaire51: Does anyone know about exel
09:25 blondetrader: :) its likely to retest
09:26 Millionaire51: Stick with Apple
09:26 blondetrader: and rty if that doesnt lod we r looking at a break of 1500 to 1485ish
09:26 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: there's the computer buy orders on AAPL
09:28 invertedhammer: Ty
09:28 Millionaire51: Uncle just bought 5k shares of apple . Said he will by more by noon
09:30 invertedhammer: Short 44
09:31 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: we'll see what happens.  if it breaks the 50 day again, market might roll over too.  but so far looking good.
09:32 esmal: Can you change the default order type to be a sequential, 1st trgs seq
09:34 gdr: hello traders, we are in the midst of our market correction
09:34 blondetrader: gm gdr
09:35 gdr: hi bt
09:36 blondetrader: :)
09:37 gdr: are we still buying dips?
09:37 blondetrader: I am waiting to see some targets
09:39 gdr: ok to ask whhich ones?
09:40 blondetrader: well es 2690s short term
09:40 blondetrader: as long as under 76
09:40 blondetrader: near term
09:41 gdr: new lows
09:41 blondetrader: ya 
09:42 blondetrader: but that said on way down if 2730 was to hold.....that new low may not come till AFTER a nice multi day rally
09:42 gerardom: red red and more red
09:42 gdr: imho new lows would be bearish
09:42 blondetrader: regardless we r mid cycle ehre
09:43 gdr: but still way above a bear mkt
09:43 blondetrader: well GDR at first glance I would agree but if you look at the yearly chart.....a new low would take us into a mid point that could be concidered bullish
09:43 blondetrader: exactly
09:43 blondetrader: it would be great if the low coincided with a bullish news event :)
09:45 blondetrader: based on 4 hr rty looks like overall last week low will break
09:45 gerardom: here comes another 2 or so days of red i feel
09:46 AlphaInvestor: I have an order "stuck" in cancel/eplace stautus - so I cannot add new orders that share those strikes. Anybody else experience this, and have a solutiont/workaround?
09:46 gdr: i like your chart view but the only good news imho would be ending trade wars restoring the alliance opening borders etc etc all unlikely
09:47 gdr: it happened lots before electronic trading
09:47 gdr: alpha are you in a fast market?
09:47 chenmann: i just wanna say i have no idea where markets r gonna go.....
09:47 chenmann: nice gdr...fast amret
09:48 chenmann: market
09:48 chenmann: just follow em....crooks
09:48 gdr: im on mobile too chen
09:48 chenmann: lol
09:48 Vimes: they are going to go up,if you wait long enough
09:49 chenmann: fast market = getting killed
09:49 gdr: us equities have always recovered Vimes, its just time to recovery which varies
09:50 Vimes: "long enough"
09:50 gdr: chen what happened to the long view? paint the fence wash the car
09:52 Vimes: EHC, strong today
09:52 chenmann: saw them setting it up 2 weeks ago, wish shorted more and held, this wave was much more and faster the before.....
09:52 chenmann: ....and right into er run.....crooks
09:53 radon224: wtf was that?
09:53 mthfr_vaxxed: someone posted large image that admin probably removed

09:59 Vimes: good advice, thx
10:00 Vimes: could have a a bad Q1
10:00 AlphaInvestor: Had to call the trade desk to get that HON option trade cancelled, they had to call ICE
10:00 mep1976: chen - MJ is a good etf for weed

10:08 chenmann: nice dan, careful target cut today
10:08 chenmann: nflx
10:09 RandomDan: yeah... that gave the opening
10:09 gdr: not questioning it ai, I just never knew it
10:10 mep1976: @al - long term play on opioid crisis
10:10 RandomDan: pre-er speculation should make it move enough.
10:10 RandomDan: my target is $338
10:11 RandomDan: but if I see weakness I can let it go sooner
10:11 mep1976: @al - i listended to a presentation for 3 hours
10:11 mep1976: in BDSI
10:11 RandomDan: like 335
10:11 mep1976: there growing scripts
10:12 RandomDan: no volume Marcos, no liquidity
10:12 mep1976: doctors are getting away from opioids scripts
10:12 RandomDan: low market cap
10:12 mep1976: BDSI for me for ling term
10:12 mep1976: long term
10:12 RandomDan: ok

10:13 mep1976: GL random
10:13 mep1976: I need to research that one
10:13 RandomDan: same to you Marcos
10:14 mep1976: how about SNAP ?
10:15 AlphaInvestor: snap  - done for
10:15 AlphaInvestor: snap gunna go the way of the dodo bird, like SHLD
10:16 mep1976: I've been selling puts in there
10:16 mep1976: hopefully get put some stock
10:16 Annie: Would like ask about YVR? Price went up 4.05
10:16 AlphaInvestor: reverse split
10:16 AlphaInvestor: 5 to 1
10:17 Annie: So can I sell now?
10:17 tmoney20g: will it be a good trade if you did ?
10:17 AlphaInvestor: that is irrelevant
10:18 AlphaInvestor: the question is whether today's price is a good price, regardless of what yoiu paid some day in that past .... Anchoring Bias   and    Loss Aversion Bias
10:20 Annie: ok got it. thanks
10:21 Vimes: me thinks this is all BS, but if you honestly just hadd 4x move i would take some off
10:21 katherine1234: anyone know how tofind EOY 2017 balance?
10:23 AlphaInvestor: She didn't have a 4x move, the had a 5:1 reverse split and has 1/5th the number of shares, at 5x t he price
10:25 VolCrush: gm admin_tculs
10:25 VolCrush: gm groovers
10:27 Vimes: oic, didn't see the stock split on my chart
10:27 Vimes: sorry ai
10:27 admin_tculs: gm vol
10:27 katherine1234: anyone know how to find eoy 2017 ir abalance?
10:27 VolCrush: covered CGC on this spike, flat
10:28 Vimes: i'm not sure what you are asking katherine, so not sure
10:28 AlphaInvestor: katherine - dig up your paper statements?
10:28 gdr: Vimes reread ai's first post, gain/ loss is irrelevant to any current/future trading decision, only future outlook matters
10:28 katherine1234: i dont have
10:28 Vimes: yeah,yeah, i just didn't see all the posts
10:28 AlphaInvestor: Gdr/Vimes - but we all do it, I want all my trades to be green before I close them - I am human after all
10:29 katherine1234: ive had a request openf ro an hour
10:29 AlphaInvestor: well, bad mouthing TOS in here with a group of seasoned TOS traders won't get you much support either
10:30 katherine1234: lol

10:34 lilFish: these green shoots makes me feel bullish
10:34 AlphaInvestor: Katherine - Monitor - Account Statement - set the date using the pulldown at   "1 days back from today"
10:36 Scott_OT: shes prolly gone after her last post
10:36 AlphaInvestor: Scott - her loss, there are some in here that know more than the TOS support staff
10:37 AlphaInvestor: ever more knowledge in the thinkScript chat room
10:37 AlphaInvestor: Some of the TOS support staff are fantastic tho
10:37 radon224: lol, nice recovery AI
10:37 Scott_OT: nice recover
10:38 YClan: Hi,     what are you guys doing in here today?
10:39 tmoney20g: stuffs ?
10:40 AlphaInvestor: Radon - not all the support staff have been using the platform as long as some of the folks in here. It makes logical sense.
10:40 YClan: That is nice.
10:40 YClan: :39 News Bot: Atlanta Fed GDPNow (Q3) 4.0% (Prev. 4.2%)
 
10:42 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I wonder how much AAPL pays cnbc to hype their company on regular basis.
10:42 AlphaInvestor: Yclan - I think TnT has been working with the Atlanta FED to fix their random number generator
10:43 YClan: Darryl,    the game is rigged
10:43 chenmann: +
10:44 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I am glued to AAPL action, if it drops, whole market drops.  If it holds, market holds.
10:45 radon224: It could be the other way around.  Correlation is different than Causation.
10:46 AlphaInvestor: If it is rigged, find out how that it is rigged ... and use that to your advantage
10:46 chenmann: ++
10:46 gerardom: i hope apple can manage, i bought some. feeling some regret atm
10:47 YClan: ger,   all you need is WarBuf to come in a buy, and you are good.
10:47 anonp: TOS OnDemand charts seems to be broken, not moving while clock is running
10:47 gerardom: YC call him to buy haha
10:47 gerardom: you guys staying on your toes today, wild market
10:48 YClan: He should sell AAPL and buy SHLD and JCP.
10:49 gerardom: whiles hes at some amzn
10:49 YClan: Ger,   I bought CRON and am riding that into the sunset today.
10:50 gerardom: hows that treating you
10:50 gerardom: nice %?
10:51 YClan: Ger,  well.. the CRON chart is trending up..     AAPL is sideways to down.
10:51 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: AAPL 50 day exponential at 217.11
10:52 mep1976: snap putting couple good days
10:53 tmoney20g: yay Yclan is here
10:53 TheOnceAndFuture: what is going on with spy.. .sheesh
10:53 YClan: tmo,    but I got no game
10:54 YClan: Future,    just follow VIX.... 21 handle
10:54 gerardom: vix needs to tank already
10:55 TheOnceAndFuture: 
"21 handle"?
10:55 RandomDan: rug pullers giving it a go but don't seem to have the firepower
10:55 YClan: means   21.xx
10:55 TheOnceAndFuture: gotcha
10:57 RandomDan: I never understood the "handle" expression, just seems weird
10:57 YClan: Tesla Inc.  has filed to trademark "Teslaquila," which was part of several  April Fools' Day  jokes tweeted by Chief Executive  Elon Musk .    (Looks like Muskrat is focusing on the important things)
10:59 VolCrush: Muskrat?  did someone request some Captain and Tenille?
10:59 lilFish: oh lawdy
11:00 lilFish: gm vol - how was your weekend?
11:01 VolCrush: vary nice ty, how was yours
11:02 lilFish: great
11:02 lilFish: was hoping for that bounce today tho
11:10 tmoney20g: esmal, no winners today for me
11:17 jayintl: which chat room is for swing traders?
11:20 lilFish: lots of em here jay
11:22 jayintl: thx Fish
11:22 tanker: cannabis  hot today,,,,CRON up .90   CGC up  5.08
11:23 esmal: damn sorry to hear :( losses werent too bad were they?
11:23 RandomDan: carpeting people showed up
11:24 AlphaInvestor: Dan - MHK ?
11:24 RandomDan: MHK?
11:25 AlphaInvestor: Mohawk - a carpet manufacturer
11:25 RandomDan: no... just the opposite of rug pullerd
11:25 RandomDan: pullers
11:25 RandomDan: Mohawk trade?
11:26 RandomDan: jesus MHK has lost 120 points ytd
11:27 RandomDan: practically at a three year low
11:27 AlphaInvestor: signs that the housing industry isn't as hot as some make it out to be
11:28 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: another complete long green would be nice on Qs,  5m
11:28 RandomDan: yeah, well the homebuilders show you that more directly. I would think most carpeting is commercial.
11:30 tmoney20g: esmal, nah, just no winners
11:30 gerardom: no good entrys
11:30 gerardom: f me
11:31 RandomDan: carpeting also needs regular replacement. I am surprised MHK is sp sensitive.
11:31 RandomDan: so
11:31 tmoney20g: i'll wait till tomorrow
11:31 RandomDan: I would have expected it to be more of a cash cow.
11:36 RandomDan: 
11:36 AlphaInvestor: it does throw free cash, but the Levered Free Cash Flow Margin is only 1.4% (my calculation) - not a cash cow
11:36 RandomDan: too much debt?
11:37 AlphaInvestor: Debt/Equity is 0.41 which is reasonable for a manufacturer
11:38 RandomDan: new exit target for my nflx trade today is $336.
11:39 AlphaInvestor: Profit margin is 9.3%, so they must be spending too much capital
11:40 RandomDan: I'll look into the company later
11:40 RandomDan: A drop loke that gets me interested.
11:40 RandomDan: like
11:41 RandomDan: BTW over the weekebd it hit me that Bershire should get into textiles.
11:41 Vimes: umm, aren't they?
11:41 AlphaInvestor: Dan - great idea
11:42 RandomDan: I know, ain't it? I am going to write uncle Warren a letter.
11:42 Vimes: i think i missed the joke :)
11:42 AlphaInvestor: Actually Brk/A does own the other very large carpeting manufacturer - Shaw Industries

11:43 AlphaInvestor: Berkshire Hathaway started as a textile mill
11:43 Vimes: as well as most vertical integrated industires
11:43 RandomDan: The joke is that Buffet considers it his worst investment.
11:44 AlphaInvestor: it was a "cigar butt" investment using Benjamin Graham's nomenclature
11:44 RandomDan: but he kept the name of the company.
11:44 RandomDan: he's got a sly sense of humorm
11:44 RandomDan: humor
11:50 mep1976: someone agrees today with me in BDSI
11:51 RandomDan: probably more than one person saw that preso
11:52 mep1976: yup
11:53 RandomDan: 335 resistance for nflx, keeps bouncing off

12:16 Arasmith: I am new to TD Ameritrade. I just opened an account this weekend and put $75 into that account. I have tried A few times to buy some stock, and my orders keep getting rejected. I was just wondering if it was because I do not have enough money in my account to cover commission, If I need to buy a minimum amount of stocks, if it is the stock that I am trying to buy, or if it’s something else. Please let me know.

12:18 YClan: ara,   you can buy just 1 share and there is no minimum purchase.  To buy/sell 1 share or 10,000 shares should be about $7  ($14-15 round trip).

17:03 yoz: How's MedMen look now AI??
17:04 yoz: doubled market cap since I posted about it but still loses a dollar for every dollar in rev?
17:04 yoz: sounds like a winning ticker to me!
17:10 yoz: so what's all this Saudi drama going to do to oil prices?  What I've been reading is that it could skyrocket oil if it all leads to heavy tariffs on Saudi oil, so.. you guessed it, GUSH may jump back up to 40+ real quick if it turns our the Saudis killed that guy
17:14 tmoney20g: Al, what indicators do you use ?
17:14 tmoney20g: since tos has so darn many
17:15 AlphaInvestor: I use several - Bollinger Bands, ADX, LinearRegressionChannel are some of the built in ones that I use
17:16 tmoney20g: i'll take a peek at those
17:16 tmoney20g: i'm in the studies dictionary now
17:16 AlphaInvestor: I also use RSI_Laguerre, Fractal Pivots, Pivots with Projections, The ORB, the real IV_Percentile
17:17 AlphaInvestor: custom studies
17:18 AlphaInvestor: and a few of my own concoction like Internal Bar Strength, Absolute Momentum
17:21 AlphaInvestor: Tmoney - since you are getting more into Options, IMO this is the most important study for options traders. Meant to be used on 1 Year Daily chart
http://tos.mx/bO1Rr7#
17:23 AlphaInvestor: I am heading out, if you have any questions, hit me up tomorrow
17:35 tmoney20g: ok ty

17:50 TheOnceAndFuture: Add it in TOS manually
17:52 EllyEl: is GE dead or is this a nice supply zone?!
18:03 Kobias: Wouldn't touch it before $9
18:15 RandomDan: I don't think GE gets to 9.
18:17 RandomDan: I got some at 11.24, and that was fleeting. That bottom may be tested again, but it was quite a support.
18:17 chenmannmobile: nice trade nflx today dan, did u take profit
18:17 chenmannmobile: ?
18:18 ameriman: Your TLRY is back up new swing high
18:19 ameriman: Near swing high
18:19 ameriman: GE made higher high so now more probable to make higher low and move up
18:19 chenmannmobile: they gonna push all pot stocks up before the 17th
18:21 tmoney20g: its almost like earnings
18:21 tmoney20g: except its pot legalization
18:23 RandomDan: yes chen I did. sold the same 50 @ 337.60, so a clean $500. still holding another 100 I have had for a while, (336 pp, so a bit under water now). Not sure how to play it tomorrow.
18:23 chenmannmobile: nice
18:25 RandomDan: well... we'll see. Sure the trade was nice, but if I hold the 100 and ER goes south, no joy there
18:25 chenmannmobile: u gonna gamble and hold over er?
18:26 RandomDan: I usually don't.
18:26 RandomDan: but I am torn.
18:26 chenmannmobile: yeah, not sure
18:27 chenmannmobile: but i think there s a bid under nio, someone s buying every time near 7
18:27 RandomDan: it's already been punished by tye last ER, so the bar is considerably lower
18:28 RandomDan: yes, I agree with NIO. I was able to pick some up under $7 only once.
18:28 RandomDan: about $6.80
18:29 RandomDan: it did touch lower tyan that though.
18:29 RandomDan: like $6.20 or something.
18:30 RandomDan: but didn't last very long.
18:32 RandomDan: any thoughts on NIO or NFLX chen?
18:32 chenmannmobile: like nio
18:32 amalia: Buy them.
18:32 chenmannmobile: think nflx will pop on er, but only for a day or two....
18:33 chenmannmobile: i may gamble on nflx tomorrow just for an er pop, not sure yet
18:37 tmoney20g: wouldn't have worked last quarter
18:37 tmoney20g: just be careful
18:37 RandomDan: I am still guarded on the rest of the market. NVDA weakness surprised me today.
18:37 chenmannmobile: yep
18:37 RandomDan: Chen if I get rid of my NFLX, I will let you know.
18:37 chenmannmobile: not sure what happened there....nvda
18:37 chenmannmobile: k
18:39 RandomDan: I am in the red with nvda, gs, twtr
18:39 RandomDan: I especially want to get rid of gs. It's been a complete dog
18:40 chenmannmobile: gs er tomorrow morning
18:40 RandomDan: yep
18:40 Kobias: Dan, GE got serious resistance 12.25~12.40 I just don't see it got the energy to cross it
18:41 RandomDan: Kobias, no idea.
18:41 RandomDan: It was above 13 till the market tanked.
18:41 Kobias: I'm following it for some months. Even tried to short it when it was at 12.20... S/R at those levels was too strong and I got out even more or less
18:42 RandomDan: In this environment, no idea.
18:42 chenmannmobile: true
18:42 Kobias: agreed...
18:42 RandomDan: I bought very well and have only 200 shares now, so not really worried.
18:42 RandomDan: nvda, gs, much bigger probs.
18:43 Kobias: Am still holding my Nov calls on ADBE - had nice move after hours nut I think it may be just shortcovering
18:43 Kobias: but*
18:43 RandomDan: definitely some chatter around that name now.
18:44 Kobias: plz share
18:44 Kobias: or link
18:45 RandomDan: just been seeing it a lot tgis past week or so. Nothing specific.
18:45 RandomDan: this
18:45 Kobias: I צקשמ ןכ איקרק,ד דםצקאיןמע נקטםמג איקןר עוןגשמבק
18:45 RandomDan: ?
18:45 chenmannmobile: adbe news after hours
18:45 Kobias: Meaning If you got something beyond their guidance
18:45 RandomDan: Nie wiem
18:45 Kobias: sorry about that
18:45 chenmannmobile: reaffirming guidence
18:46 RandomDan: yeah, I don't think it was short covering
18:46 Kobias: ok that's cool. I thought there's more news. Once in a while there's a rumor that MSFT is going to buy them.
18:48 Kobias: Already in 2016 I heard it first
18:48 RandomDan: that would suck
18:48 ameriman: You are a doctor?
18:48 ameriman: google translate
18:49 Kobias: lol this won't work - it's giberish -I thought I was typing in english
18:50 RandomDan: I thought you knew hebrew
18:50 Kobias: Of course I do
18:51 Kobias: But I was typing in english while the keyboard was set on hebrew font. thus giberish...
18:52 RandomDan: I see.
18:52 Kobias: our keyboards are dual language naturally.
18:54 RandomDan: I understand. I have my phone set for English, Spanish, and Polish
18:54 tmoney20g: can i play a day, like rewind today and have it start over ?
18:54 tmoney20g: in tos ?
18:54 Kobias: Well I hope you're right, and it's not short covering... I am taking pain on this position the last week.
18:54 RandomDan: on my phone
18:55 Kobias: cool
18:56 ameriman: tmoney ondemand feature
18:56 RandomDan: on my computer I have a US keyboatd but set to US-International.
18:56 tmoney20g: i see it, i'll mess with it
18:56 tmoney20g: thanks ameri
18:56 RandomDan: so you might see some weird letter from me every once in a whilę
18:57 Kobias: I got Heb, Eng - and used to have Rus too -- for my ex :)
18:57 ameriman: yw, close all charts and keep only one open for ondemand to work best, also avoid complex custom studies
19:08 tmoney20g: ameri, guess i can't replay today, until tomorrow ?
19:26 RandomDan: a lot of techs higher AH
19:30 tmoney20g: any trailing stop pros here ?
19:31 tmoney20g: wondering if, say you set a percentage trail, does it stay with the percentage when you bought it ?
19:31 tmoney20g: or say its 10%, is it always 10% of whatever the current price is
19:33 ameriman: /NQ and /ES up so tech also up
19:33 phil: hello everyone
19:33 tmoney20g: hi
19:33 ameriman: Yes 10% of current price
19:33 ameriman: But I never use trailing stop
19:34 tmoney20g: ok
19:34 phil: question..today I tried selling my shares . I put it on stop. I rejected my stop trade? why?
19:34 tmoney20g: so if you're in a call option that goes from like 2500 to 4000, its best to track it and shrink the percentage
19:35 ameriman: I just read the tape
19:35 phil: has that happened to anyone?
19:35 ameriman: I’d tape tells me to exit I exit
19:35 ameriman: If
19:35 tmoney20g: phil, if you expand the trade in the trade tab, it should say why it was rejected
19:36 phil: weird..how do I do that?
19:37 tmoney20g: you on mobile or computer
19:37 ameriman: If you had stop limit and were trading a wide bid ask spread stock and the spread jumped over your stop limit it won’t execute
19:37 ameriman: That is why I avoid wide bid ask stocks
19:38 ameriman: Usually pennies are wide
19:38 phil: the stock was at 173..I put it at 170 stop..it rejected it outright
19:38 ameriman: What is current price of stock?
19:39 phil: it never reached 170 today but it is now at 171
19:39 ameriman: The sentence cut off, it is now at what?
19:39 phil: at 171
19:40 ameriman: If it never went below 170 then why do you expect stop to have executed?
19:40 phil: when I sent out my order it said rejected...and its under cancel
19:41 ameriman: Did you send order after hours?
19:41 phil: so are you saying it remains rejected status until it hits 170
19:41 ameriman: No
19:42 phil: i sent one order before hours and one order during hours, the sane ordet
19:42 phil: the same order
19:42 ameriman: Then call support so they can look into your account to see why this happened
19:43 phil: makes no sense why its rejected..will speak to a td rep
19:43 phil: yeah I think that is what I should do..Thanks..but very bizarre
19:44 phil: thanks ameriman
19:44 ameriman: yw
19:45 ameriman: When sending order before or after hours you have to select EXT otherwise it won’t get placed

13:03 Vimes: step, your example works for me back to max available data, daily bars, the low gets plotted
13:03 Nube: I have never tried this but there is a first() function and I can't say whether that will carry the value to other bars so first(low) might be worth a try
13:04 stepandfetchit:    Note that the first 9 bars have the issue!  -- the yellow is just plotting the low
13:05 stepandfetchit: What am I doing wrong?  -- 
13:05 Nube: post the code, step
13:06 Vimes: here's my same example, and it seems to work:
13:06 Nube: May well be doing nothing wrong
13:06 stepandfetchit: Good point!  Let me do a clean build.  Likely something else is causing the greif!
13:08 AlphaInvestor: Step - who the heck cares what the low was 15 years ago, really?
13:09 stepandfetchit: Vimes:  Thanks!  -- I must have a bug.
13:09 AlphaInvestor: Or, asked a different way.   How will knowing what the low was 15 years ago make you more money tomorrow?
13:10 stepandfetchit: Alpha... This thnkscrpt is examining distance between new lows, so begins with most historice point, and advances to recient, so need it to START!
13:11 AlphaInvestor: so if it starts 15 years minus 9 days instead of a full 15 years ago your strategy is ruined?
13:12 Vimes: again i think for most studies there is a prefetch that is automatic, though not familiar 100%, if you really want to take care of initializing a variable use compoundvalue
13:12 AlphaInvestor: prefetch works on all Moving Averages
13:12 Vimes: oic
13:13 AlphaInvestor: since BollingerBands includes a moving average, it works too
13:14 AlphaInvestor: sometimes, if you include a moving average in you list of studies, it will do the prefetch for all the other studies too ... YMMV
13:14 AlphaInvestor: this is consistently inconsistent
13:15 MTS1: "Three thinkScript� functions use prefetch: ExpAverage, EMA2, and WildersAverage." http://tlc.thinkorswim.com/center/howToTos/tutorials/Advanced/Chapter-12---Past-Offset-and-Prefetch.html; but I thought the SMA also. .
13:17 Nube: Average will, MTS. through a 200 day on a chart and it will plot from the first bar.
13:17 Nube: *Throw
13:17 MTS1: Yea; even the documentation that is there cannot always be relied on;)
13:17 AlphaInvestor: well, average is a moving average ... so
13:18 MTS1: Point is when I read doc before it specifically states EMA's and then lists the 3; I did not think it was all MA's which is why I looked it up again.
13:21 MTS1: Hm; maybe that's how the scanner looks back further; we found the other day the scanner not looking back as far as doc states, but maybe doc is considering prefetch also?
13:22 stepandfetchit: @ Alpha...  I just need to programatically determine when valid data can be referenced.  So, in this case, if  KNEW the first 9 bars were not avail, then I just start with next bar. So, if this IS related to "prefetch" amount, If I can compute the #bars of prefetct, I can use that to avoid the issue.  Is there a way to compute PREFETCH withing a thinkscript?
13:23 AlphaInvestor: Nube answered that use isNAN() to determine when you don't have valid data
13:24 AlphaInvestor: Does anybody else have a problem with either a) the Study  AccountNetLiq ... or b) the function   GetNetLiq()
13:25 AlphaInvestor: I have never had it return a net liq for me
13:25 stepandfetchit: Alpha... That does not work for the leading  (oldest) case!  -- 
13:26 stepandfetchit: I'll figure something out.
13:26 AlphaInvestor: what, you cannot use isnan() on the first 9 bars of the chart ... huh?
13:26 stepandfetchit: correct!
13:26 AlphaInvestor: that function should work on any bar on the chart
13:27 stepandfetchit: Agreed!
13:27 stepandfetchit: There is some "prefetch" issue I am bumping into
13:27 stepandfetchit: I will hack arround it, but was hopeing for a more elegent solution.
13:28 stepandfetchit: I may toy with that "compound" function (which I have not been using)
13:28 MTS1: steph, this has nothing to do with prefetch
13:29 AlphaInvestor: what exactly are you trying to do?
13:29 stepandfetchit: MTS1:  Can you enlighten me?  -- you are probalby correct,
13:29 MTS1: isnan works on any bar, but so should low. .
13:29 MTS1: Steph; look at the link I posted
13:30 AlphaInvestor: Step - if you are trying to do something like     close > low[9]     that is pulling data from 9 bars ago ... which won't work on the first 9 bars because that data won't exist
13:31 AlphaInvestor: compoundvalue cannot pull data from before the start of the chart either
13:32 stepandfetchit: Ah!  So, is NOT related to Prefetch (per your above ref).   Do you know what it May be related to?  -- is influenced by chart size (# bars trying to show), and influenced by any look-back references.
13:32 MTS1: but refering to prefetch close > Avg(low,1)[9] may work.
13:32 AlphaInvestor: what is the    IT    you refer to
13:32 MTS1: No steph; sounds like a data feed issue
13:33 MTS1: ignore my avg prefetch example; it only pre-fetches the number of bars data needed for the average.
13:37 AlphaInvestor: Tculs - do you or anybody working the Trade Desk today have any experience with either a) the Study  AccountNetLiq ... or b) the function   GetNetLiq()
13:39 stepandfetchit: Kinda interesting observation:  Attempt to plot "barnumber()", missing the leading bars as well!
13:40 MTS1: AI; I have nothign special in my accout and both seem to work for me. Have you tried emailing TS Support?
13:40 AlphaInvestor: all symbols, or just one symbol?
13:41 AlphaInvestor: MTS - I haven't, I was gunna call today to discuss ... but was asking Tculs if anybody with knowledge was in to discuss it with me
13:44 AlphaInvestor: MTS - I have a couple "special" things in my portfolio. One with a Q at then end of the symbol, one worth 0.0003 per share, a couple recent spinouts, and 10 leftover Washington Mutual Inc Escrow thingies
13:44 MTS1: I've not tried often, but seems eml is easier for TS specific issue; not timely respose but probably gets to the right person to answer. Seems like TradeDesk has to transfer / refer to TS team which when I've called after hours they said only in during the weekdays.
13:45 MTS1: But I've not been around long and go here for most my TS support needs;)
13:46 MTS1: Oh; no symbol; just just blank function w/o inputs and dropped the study on a chart; happened to be $TICKAR chart;)
13:46 stepandfetchit: If interested:  This seems to find the "mysterious" leading "unreferenceable BARS": def secret = first(barnumber());
13:50 AlphaInvestor: MTS - what is the TS Support e-mail?
13:50 MTS1: Steph; guess not sure what the issue with IT is; or why your script would not work because of it. Pretend the first bars are not there and the chart starts after that? It sounds weird, but is what it is I guess. Can pass it to support and see what they find; but probably need to give them ticker and chart timeframe.
13:52 MTS1: AI; thinkscript@thinkorswim.com is what I've used.
13:53 Burns56: Hi I am looking for some help on how to combine 3 lower studies into one complete study, I can easily do it on my computer but i am trying to combine to see if they will load on my ipad , any help would be greatly appreciated                                                                  ## TD Ameritrade IP Company, Inc.

13:54 MTS1: Burns; did you see what that looked like before you hit enter?
13:55 stepandfetchit: MTS1:  I think I can code arround this now, using that First(barnum.. kludge!  
13:55 Vimes: still not sure its an issue if you had a more reasonable chart horizon i doubt you would see the issue
13:56 Vimes: and even on my chart with 15 years it works fine
13:56 Burns56: http://tos.mx/swR1qD#
13:56 Vimes: Burns, has redacted his own study
13:58 stepandfetchit: Vimes:  Some of my scripts requrie some lookback/lookforward, so looking for a generic solution for them as well. --  This seems to be at least a partial solution for me.
14:01 JohnnyQs_BackupWks: the LoungeArchive is current.  It even contains Burns56's invisible study
14:01 AlphaInvestor: Thanks MTS - emailing them now
14:02 Burns56: I apologize its like i am using disappearing typing, Help
14:02 MTS1: Burns; I won't open a workspace I don't need unless maybe I'm in PM; maybe try sharing the chart or the script? As for posting script directly in here; try to run it through something like notepad so that there is no extra formatting like from e-mail or word etc added.
14:02 Vimes: step, i get that but i guess what i'm saying is even if you have let's say a 6M, 1D chart with a 9 period lookback TOS will still look past your current chart setting, you typically do not need to do anything special:  This is plottting close[9] for example.
14:03 MTS1: Burns; please exit and re-enter the room to fix your font.
14:05 MTS1: Vimes; not what I've seen; is that the far left of your chart? Maybe they changed somethign. .
14:05 Vimes: that is the left of my chart,yes
14:05 Vimes: no other lower studies or upper studies

14:08 MTS1: That is strange Vimes; I think that may be new. Just tried it on shorter SPY chart and see the same as you, with max available is the only time it starts after the lookback index period. .
14:08 Burns56: I’m sorry if it didn’t come out correctly I don’t have a lot of experience with posting here. But it’s three separate lower studies that I’m trying to combine into one so hopefully I can load on my phone when I’m traveling
14:09 MTS1: Burns; on your PC exit the room and re-enter that will fix it.
14:10 MTS1: Then see if you have a better formatted script that you can paste from notepad
14:11 stepandfetchit: If anyone is interested in an example for what I observer on certain Symbols when time frame is very very large, here is simple script:
14:11 stepandfetchit: 
plot apriorclose=close[5];
def secret = first(barnumber());
plot sc=secret;
addlabel(1,secret);
#
14:12 AlphaInvestor: WOW!!! that script from Burns is even worse now that I can see it
14:12 stepandfetchit: Use VXX or UVXY with 15 years to observe, then switch to spy or something
14:12 MTS1: Burns; Also at first glance it looks like you should just be able to append the scripts together into one; just take out the extra 'declare lowers'. The issue may be scaling; in which case the studies have to be normalized. May be easier to just overlay the 3 scripts in which case TOS does the normalization automagically.
14:12 amalia: lol
14:12 MTS1: Using white background now AI?
14:12 MTS1: ;)
14:12 MTS1: Oh the re-post. .
14:14 MTS1: First one actually looked better;)
14:16 Burns56:  
14:16 hbmicro: AI, Burnout again???
14:16 Burns56: sorry is that to big?
14:16 Burns56: 75% reduced
14:18 MTS1: Burns; what are those 3 different indicators at the bottom?
14:18 amalia: Try 10
14:18 Burns56: "WOW!!! that script from Burns is even worse now that I can see it" Omg i needed a belly laugh thanks / now you know you are dealing with a genius. sorry i will exit stage left
14:20 Burns56: RSI, This indicator that this gentlemean hahn shared and i modified a little and another called traders tips divergence that i dont know how or when i got it
14:20 MTS1: So RSI goes between 0 and 100; the other ones?
14:21 Burns56: i can post them one at a time or probably better to not torture you guys with my insanity
14:22 Burns56: the rsi is standard
14:22 amalia: One at a time is good

14:29 Burns56: This is the third studythey all work fine when I combined them separately on my computer into one lower chart individually
14:30 Burns56: I would like to be able to write them into one study combined without having three separate lower studies because I haven’t figured out how to combine three separate studies on my iPad manually
14:30 Vimes: the advantage of having them separate is when you drag them together TOS will autofit them to the lower panel, why do you want them in one study again?
14:30 Vimes: ^
14:30 Vimes: oh
14:31 Burns56: Yeah when I’m traveling I’d like to be able to get out of the SPY using this chart I guess I could bring my laptop
14:31 MTS1: Burns; the first study does not work; it has a function Li in there that does not exist; you probably have a typo.
14:32 Vimes: out of curiousity what are you trading that you want to see divergence with CL and correlation with SPX?
14:32 Burns56: Sorry the first studyis just a standard RSI that comes loaded in thinkorswim I must’ve copied and paste it it incorrectly
14:32 Vimes: Li should be absvalue()
14:34 Burns56: Yeah it’s funny that it’s giving a pretty good signal for me when to get out of the market when one of the cyan line crosses below to exit in both cyan lines cross above the pink line to enterWhat do you can correlate it up just about against anything on the platform It gives you that potential
14:36 Burns56: Of course this was last year’s market conditions who knows now
14:38 Burns56: If anyone could improve on it that would be great .I’m just like a kindergartner working with it
14:39 MTS1: Well; this is what it looks like on one chart; not sure if normalizing would do much for you either:  
14:43 amalia: Well, glad that got settled. Next!
14:44 Nube: Burns, which condition for each of those indicators do you look for when deciding to exit?
14:46 amalia: Burns left.
14:50 AlphaInvestor: Sometimes peeps on phones and pads don't show up in the list of People in Room
14:50 amalia: Pictures or it didn’t happen
14:54 Nube: Maybe he's having Smithers monitor the chat for him.
14:55 AlphaInvestor: Nube - berged for TV prefereces ... I had to look that up
14:55 Burns56: Sorry I have something on the stove brb
14:56 Vimes: you never watched the simpsons alpha, cmon, man!
14:56 AlphaInvestor: I can say that I have never suffered thru a whole episode
14:56 MTS1: wow. .
14:57 Nube: Put together a silly Correlation Index and then got to thinking maybe o should take it serious. Anyone know what some of the most common factors are that quants tend to use? With there being an ETF for everything now we could probably see when those correlations get egg shaped
14:58 AlphaInvestor: Nube - I know the factors in common use
14:58 AlphaInvestor: most of the underlying data needed is not available in thinkScript
14:59 amalia: ^
15:00 amalia: >=|
15:00 MTS1: TCULS; could you please delete my picture? 
15:02 amalia: Why
15:03 Nube: Drats, Alpha. I was hoping to have it be simple.
15:04 Nube: If there isn't a price to sales etf, or price to ebit etc then we have ourselves a niche to fill.
15:05 twoshoes: TDA should start a "Fantasy ETF" league.
15:06 Vimes: nube, you may already know this but look up the crsp indexes, all (i believe) are available on TOS,
15:06 Vimes: http://www.crsp.com/indexes-pages/crsp-indexes-quick-reference-guide
15:06 Burns56: MTS thank you
15:07 amalia: yw
15:08 Nube: I didn't know that, Vimes. Thanks. That will help out a lot.
15:09 Vimes: it doesn't capture yet some of the volatility facotr investments but has the majority of the common investment styles tracked
15:09 AlphaInvestor: TwoShoes - one recently shut down, that I cannot name here
15:10 AlphaInvestor: Thanks Vimes - news to me too
15:15 Vimes: again, likely obvious but you would just use the index identifier for the symbol in tos, the totral return indexes can be helpful if you want to simulate returns with dividends, (however they don't have volume) so you wouldn't be able to get to carried away: CRSPTMT, for example
15:18 AlphaInvestor: For the week, the winning sectors were Utilities (+1.0%), and Consumer Staples (-4.0%) if you can call a -4% a winner. The losers were Materials (-9%), and Technology and Industrials (tied at -7.0%). This is using SPDR data pulled using TOS and RTD.
15:19 Vimes: that's definitely bearish, xlu, xlp leading
15:23 amalia: I started trading after Obama came into office. What is.... bearish?
15:24 AlphaInvestor: yung pup
15:25 AlphaInvestor: dats when minRange quits workin'
15:25 amalia: lmao
15:26 Nube: Emerging markets outperforming is not bearish.
15:26 Nube: So all is not lost yet
15:31 Nube: I'm not saying buy Brazilian Small Caps, mind you.
15:32 AlphaInvestor: Two of my "market posture" indicators went bearish on Thursday, the sector rotation model actually went bearish on 09/21
15:38 Nube: That was timely.
15:42 AlphaInvestor: belay that -- Big Hand went bearish on the daily chart, but should have been run on weekly. Still bulish now.
15:48 Nube: Pretty much every I have looks ill on the daily but weekly doesn't look worse than a normal market spill yet. There's always next week.
15:50 Nube: Limit down Sunday night is my hope.
15:50 AlphaInvestor: So I have 3 Market Posture indicators Bull, 2 Market Posture indicators Bear
15:57 Noob1: So it just occurred to me that Netflix reports on Tuesday. If mkt in the toilet could they even sail w/ gd er?
15:57 Noob1: Good earnings
16:04 MTS1: Or maybe good earnings will lift the market. . Not sure; my crystal ball indicator has a bug in it;)
16:05 MTS1: If you don't have an edge; don't play it
16:06 AlphaInvestor: since they are spheres, crystal balls don't have edges - just sayin'
16:07 MTS1: THAT's the problem with the indicator I guess; keeps going in loops!
16:08 amalia: lol
16:10 bsinks: This is pretty awesome.........didnt even know there was live chat rooms.
16:11 AlphaInvestor: Bsinks and Noob1 -- this chat room is for thinkScript coding discussions only. There are other live chat rooms open Monday to Friday if the market is open
16:12 MTS1: this one is pretty awsome though!
16:14 bsinks: Can I ask if there is a thinkscript for a custom column on the scanner for a time stamp so I can sort by time that a new stock hits the scanner.
16:15 AlphaInvestor: You can ask, that is a perfect question for this forum
16:15 AlphaInvestor: Unfortunately, there is not
16:15 bsinks: lol........story of my life.......thank you
16:17 MTS1: But if you save it as a query = dynamic watchlist, you can set it up to e-mail alerts to you when stcks get added (or removed); which you could sort in your e-mail reader.
16:18 AlphaInvestor: They will also show up in the order triggered in the Message Center
16:18 bsinks: yea thats how I watch it is in the message center......but it adds like 8 at a time
16:19 bsinks: still it works pretty good like that
16:19 Vimes: or even send you a mobile alert which is what i use
16:22 MTS1: Vimes; have you used other types also? Wonder about timing; seems like mobile alerts for order confirmations are sometimes very timely and sometimes delayed. Wonder if there can be a delay in any of the communicatoin methods and how MW alerts handles them.
16:23 Vimes: well i guess i should clarify that i'm using the trader app on mobile, it seems to alert at the exact same time as my pc platform
16:24 Vimes: even on pc  i think there is a dealy of a few minutes for watchlist alerts
16:25 MTS1: OK; have not tested / compared the different methods yet, but wonder if there's a difference between methods.
16:26 AlphaInvestor: Look at the LAST price for JPM ... does TOS know something that I haven't heard yet?
16:28 Vimes: maybe i'm not looking right, i see 106.95
16:30 AlphaInvestor: I got 0 on the Analyze Tab
16:30 AlphaInvestor: and a watchlist
16:31 AlphaInvestor: RTD pulls 106.95 -- curious
16:35 Nube: Push Alerts on the mobile app have been good in the little I have used them. Text and email are so so
16:44 JohnnyQs_BackupWks: The LoungeArchive is current.
16:45 amalia: Thanks
16:50 Paris: In case anyone is interested, I tracked down the second script that Burns56 posted. Seems that this was modified from a script that Nube posted on 7.13.2016 called BB Divergence with Mobius Standard Deviation Line.
16:53 AlphaInvestor: oh, that was back when Nube was but a noob
16:55 amalia: Thanks
16:56 amalia: Thanks
16:58 amalia: wtf
17:00 AlphaInvestor: amalia is very thankful today '-)
17:04 amalia: Dude somethings up w mobile app. It’s a recurrence
17:04 Nube: You're welcome
17:04 Burns56: Paris thank you do you have the original ? thanks
17:07 Paris: Here is the attribution of the 3 scripts that Burns56 posted earlier today.
Script 1: Standard TOS RSI study
Script 2: Modified from Nube's study called BB Divergence with Mobius Standard Deviation Line posted on 7.13.2006
Script 3: Relative Strength Scan from Hahn Tech
Note that Hahn's script is also available on Youtube
17:07 Burns56: yes thats where i got that one
17:08 Paris: Time for breakfast. BBL.
17:09 Nube: I forgot about that script. The idea was for the next step to change the bands to something more conventional but never followed through
17:10 AlphaInvestor: I have trouble reading those scripts that are all jumbled together because of the small text on my screen. However, It seems to me that it would be a happy accident that a study with /CL in it would be a good Combined Signal Approach candidate for all equities or indicies. The other two make sense, but are they really just the same thing in different clothing?
17:11 Burns56: it also looked good with $TICK and various $pcall symbols
17:12 Burns56: i checked it with some strong monthly sectors like health care and services too
17:14 Burns56: i thought it may have some potential with the vix too but i am just looking at different ideas
17:14 amalia: That’s what drew Nube’s attention away from it; looking at different ideas.
17:15 Paris: Burns56 - I'm on mobile, and to respond to your question, yes I do have Nube's original study of 2016, which is where I found the correspondence. Will be back in about an hour's time.
17:22 AlphaInvestor: got to go now - Later Traders
17:22 AlphaInvestor: Tculs - thanks for opening the room for us again today. You da bomb!
17:31 Vimes: i learned that if you hit the reformat code button, it will quickly fix the code that was pasted, just fyi
17:32 Farmin: majil
17:32 Farmin: majik
17:32 Farmin: now if they would just have a fix errors button
17:33 Vimes: thtat woudl be sweet, find replace would also be sort of convenient
17:34 Farmin: hmmm, like a grown up editor?
17:34 Vimes: exactly
17:44 Burns56: TZA symbol with $tick as secondary symbol looks interesting on that chart
17:51 Burns56:  
18:14 amalia: Uncheck Fit Studies
18:16 Bear: Hey
18:16 Bear: Does anyone know how to simulate buying trades?
18:20 amalia: OnDemand on paperMoney
18:25 G3_: Til Sunday eve open.  Good night tculs and all.
19:02 Farmin: bear, you have to hang around longer than that
19:21 amalia: Laters g3
05:44 slashgw: gm all
05:49 DMonkey: 👋
05:52 slashgw: hey DMonkey, gm.  here is the beginning of what I have been working on, based on that chartbubble code. https://screencast.com/t/54lIo4cNtAO
06:02 DMonkey: looks good
06:08 slashgw: thanks!  still working on the automation portion via Python.  able to pull the data easily enough from online, just working on formatting the output to the thinkscript file.
06:29 TICKZ: @slashgw who made that bband studie?
06:32 slashgw: tickz, that was made by a friend of mine
06:33 TICKZ: whats his name? i hve the same studie..but i dont know who made it..
06:33 slashgw: won't say his name, but initials are jb
06:33 TICKZ: ok
07:43 PhatDog: i've been trying for sometime now to come up with script to identify stocks that have less than 5 trades during the after hours/pre hours session.  anyone have such scrip?
07:44 MTS1: Phat; you could only potentially do this on a tick chart set to 1 tick, and count the bars after RTH. Look at the date/time functions for functions available to check when RTH ends.
07:47 Vimes: I don't think you can use ticks in the scanner though
07:51 PhatDog: i'd be good to count the 1 minute bars during that session.
07:52 Vimes: Phat, instead you could scan for a particular volume in pre-market
07:53 MTS1: Phat; assuming since you're looking for low volume and may not have multiple trades on the same 1 min bar that might work for you. What is the purpose of finding such stocks?
07:54 PhatDog: possibly, but ive been unable to come up with the scipt to capture a total volume during the session
07:55 Vimes: You're the first one i've heard want to look at low volume in pre-market as an indicator, but i know there have been several pre-market volume scans shared here -let me see if i have one saved
07:57 PhatDog: its one factor to identify low volume pre market stocks the move upward during the regular session
07:57 Vimes: Try this on a 1min agg in teh scanner with extended hours checked, you would need to adjust the volume threshold:
def Active = SecondsFromTime(0400) >= 0 and
                     SecondsTillTime(0930) > 0;
def vol = if Active and !Active[1]
                then volume
                else if Active
                        then vol[1] + volume
                        else vol[1];
plot isTrue = vol >= 500000;
07:59 Vimes: Phat, ok but that is going to be almost 100% of all stocks behavior (imo)
08:08 PhatDog: Vimes, tried your code with no other factors and just changed your vol to 5000 and no matches.
08:10 Vimes: works for me there are about 385 stocks >5000 and 8317!!! less than 5000 again low volume or low trade count is not going to find a needle in teh haystack so to speak
08:16 PhatDog: ah yes. so sorry. had another limiter still on.  THX!
08:16 Vimes: yw
08:27 MTS1: Logic seems contrarian to what most traders would be looking for volume wise.
08:52 HoBo: /
08:58 Vimes: Weekend update, I was digging into the Mobius volatility compression study (SqueezePivots), that was discussed in the chat last friday. I wanted to make it easier to review prior squeeze events on a historical chart, so I added some of the legacy points to the chart from the default study.  In addition, I was thinking it would be helpful to visualize the compressed trading range prior to the squeeze entry.  I used half this range to estimate a proposed risk value, which might be used against signals while "in the squeeze" range or upon squeeze exit... Finally, i thought it might be interesting to take the whole range while in the squeeze event to form the basis of a pivot projection to give a visual for potential risk off points or to better interpret the trading action after the squeeze exits, this is kept active until the next squeeze fires.  See the attached for a quick visual and the modified study.  I've placed all my code at the very bottom of the default study. Hopefully, this is additive to the original study, if anybody has any improvements or better coding skills to make it more useful/practical please feel free to modify.  Or if its complete garbage, well that's ok with me too.

09:32 JohnnyQuotron: Vimes.. what software are you using to add the text and your Name with Underline?    
09:33 Vimes: snagit
09:33 JohnnyQuotron: Good Morning Scripters...
09:33 Vimes: there is a free version i belive as well
09:34 JohnnyQuotron: vimes... thank you.
09:35 JohnnyQuotron: windows 10 not has a built it but it doesnt annotate
09:37 Vimes: you can also annotate withiin tos but a bit tedious
09:39 JohnnyQuotron: agreed. TY
09:50 nextrade: Vimes-nice-thanks for sharing !
09:50 Vimes: yw
09:52 nextrade: gives nice visual for mobius' ppo osc
10:16 nextrade: i overlay a second ppo osc- set at 20 /50 change histograms  to lines - and wait for cross at extremes
10:16 EAK: hi all.  i would like an alert on parabolicSAR and it's not available.  Can anyone here help me with this? 
10:18 Vimes: Eak, if you are willing to try, read this:

------- Saturday, October 13, 2018 -------
10:20 EAK: i'm totally coding ignorant.  do you know if this indicator can have an alert?
10:20 Mobius: Another interesting way to look at a Price Squeeze

10:21 MTS1: EAK; if you're talking about MarketWatch alerts PSAR uses recursive variables which are not allowed in MW Alerts. Chart alert function is the one Vimes mentioned which can easilly be added.
10:21 AlphaInvestor: Squeeze Bars ... now that is the kind of bar I can get my head around
10:23 Vimes: thanks mobius, will take a look later
10:23 Vimes: is there any merit to how i'm thinking about your oringal study?
10:23 Mobius: EAK - Since ParabolicSAR will scan you can setup MarketWatch alerts, email and SMS notices that way.
10:24 katherine1234: annyone know how to find EOY 2017 balance for IRA?
10:24 Mobius: Vimes - I've not been able to prove ANY statistical advantage or value to a squeeze. I keep looking though.  
10:26 Vimes: ok- i guess i'm confused then, why code the orignial squeeze study - do you not believe volatiliy compression is a valid heads up to trading?
10:27 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - it makes logical sense that Options IV should reduce while in the squeeze, then expand when the squeeze exits. Have you looke into that? If so, that would be tradable - buy options in the squeeze to sell them after it exits.
10:27 Mobius: lol   I've coded well over 10,000 studies. I find little of value in most of them.  I code because I can
10:29 EAK: Thank you Vimes and Mobius.  
10:29 EAK: and MTS1
10:30 Vimes: ok, visually to me this has some merit, maybe should try and simluate some backtest results
10:30 Mobius: Alpha.. If price squeezes and then drops IV will rise. But if price squeezes and then rises out of the squeeze IV will reduce. Without knowing which way price will breakout of the squeeze what can you sell or buy while price is in a squeeze that gives you any advantage??
10:31 Vimes: I guess it also gels with everything i've read back to dow theory, etc on periods of consolidatino, distibtuion, etc. to find the next period o f volatility expansion, so i'm not trying to challeng you more than clarify how you think about things
10:32 New_Trade: Hello smart scripters       Do you have a script to show small labels Advance and Decline value in left corner of my charts?  Would like to see it for futures /ES /NQ /GC ...and also for stocks   Thanks
10:32 AlphaInvestor: if price squeezes IV should drop, I agree that exiting the squeeze to the downside will cause a big IV rise. But exiting the squeeze to the upside could cause a minor uptick in IV ... since ATR and such went up.
10:32 Mobius: Alpha ... Prove that  :)
10:32 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - I was asking if YOU had tested that
10:33 EAK: so guys, i looked over that page, and it's foreign to me.  TD apparently won't code anything anymore.  They too told me this would be easy.  Is there ANY chance of someone coding that ParSAR alert PLEASE?
10:33 AlphaInvestor: I know logic and markets don't always go hand in hand  '-)
10:33 Mobius: I've tried and failed to find that very notion
10:35 Vimes: EAK, what alert on you exactly wanting and what did you not undrestand about the syntax of the alert functino
10:35 mthfr_vaxxed: you try looking during live markets or you use historical option chain stats to find it?
10:36 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - thanks, then I won't waste computer cycles, electrons, and precious brain cells on the search
10:36 EAK: vimes, just a simple alert to trigger when this indicator switches it's signal
10:37 DCR: Does ToS have the ability to tell what kind of options transaction took place on any given options trade.  Ie a Sweep, Tied to Stock, Spread, etc?
10:37 EAK: I don't understand much about coding.  I've tried my hand at it on and off since the intro of the PC.  I don't seem to have an aptitude for it.  
10:38 Vimes: DCR, only thing i know is the trade flash gadget
10:38 DCR: @Vimes, Thank you
10:39 Mobius: Alpha.. You may find what I couldn't.  What I found was that while in a squeeze if typical duration IV didn't do much at all. If a squeeze lasted a long time IV wold drop but not often far enough to profit from a strangle or straddle 
10:39 Mobius: Since you don't know which way price will breakout those seemed the only logical trade options to me
10:41 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - agreed in principal. But the location of prior support/resistance would enter into my decisions if doing manual trades
10:43 Mobius: Ok - What would be a scenario we could test?
10:45 Vimes: Well a squeeze to me means historical volatility is collapsing, which you are betting on a future volatily expansion?  Whether this is predictive of IV is perhaps another beast
10:47 harndog: Warning...always dangerous.... ariff on Mobius' trend line of squeeze...substitute ECI  and re-run. https://www.screencast.com/t/gW3UIkv4LfB
10:47 harndog: a riff
10:48 harndog: Note: In this script, I track the start of the Fractal Balance Point, and I call it (FBP).
10:48 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - sounds like you already tested it.
But - IV pre-squeeze - IV In the Squeeze - IV post-Squeeze - a) when squeeze exits up, b) when squeeze exits down. Sort these by Squeeze Lenght ... look for tradable patterns.
likely beyond the capability of TOS
10:49 harndog: Here is the script idea shown in the visual: http://tos.mx/EXcR0h#
10:51 harndog: I am heading out, unfortunately, but visually, tracking the FBP starts did a nice job tracking the market and how a trader should not fight a  "V" trend reversal.
10:53 Vimes:  
maybe similar view of same time frame?

10:54 New_Trade: Thank you Paris
10:55 Paris: yw
10:57 harndog: Vimes... Substituting the ECI and Mobius' flag version, "might" do a better job highlighting the expansion contraction market nature. Also, the Flag script has the ECI label measuring compression.
10:57 harndog: Again... all filtered through a padwan learner...:)
10:57 harndog: BBL
10:57 Vimes: ok will look further at your study

11:01 gary8329: In a watchlist,  is there a way to show the Week and Month opens?
11:08 EAK: Glad you guys are feeling the love.  Any way I can coax that knowledge to code my "simple alert" for ParSAR?  Thanks :)
11:11 Nube: There isn't anything to code, EAK. Just set up a scan for it and set an alert. viola.
11:11 MTS1: Gary; please clarify
11:11 MTS1: (Open whats?)
11:11 EAK: I will try that NUBE.  thx
11:18 gary8329: Week Open woud be at what price the stock opened at on the first day of the week.   Converserly, Month Open would be the opening price of the stock at the first day of the month. 
11:18 Double07trader: Hi all, anyone know if there is some setting to allow one to drag order prices on TOS chart, i can drag on demo account but not on live account (e.g. i want to move up a Stop Loss using mouse) ?
11:19 MTS1: Gary; just select open to be displayed and make sure you use the aggregations mentioned for each column
11:21 Vimes: gary, you would need to create two separete custom quotes one set for wekly aggreationg with something like
plot o = open;
and then do the exacty sme thing for the weekly
11:21 Vimes: er monthly
11:22 gary8329: I see.  Create a custom quote.
11:23 MTS1: Gary; plot o = open;

11:33 AlphaInvestor: Well, somebody get some WD-40 and un-stick it so I can get some fills
11:36 Vimes: very nice, thx
11:45 EAK: CHIEF!!!  THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!
11:46 EAK: Yes, i was yelling to make sure you heard me.  Thanks so much for helping a code challenged person.  
11:52 chief: Good learing example for you. Lots of hints. yw
12:02 EAK: You are awesome.  Have a great day!
12:34 bkstrader: I need some help from a bubble expert. I have read the JohnnyQ
Educational material and tried a few tests but I can't get current
Variable values to show up in a bubble 8 bars away from current 
Bar. Any help would be greatly appreciated here is the code
input barsFromNow = 8;
def na = Double.NaN;
def bn = BarNumber();
def currentBar = HighestAll(if !IsNaN(close) then bn else na);
def currentDay = HighestAll(if   bn == currentBar then day else na); 
def hi = HighestAll(if bn == currentBar then high else na);
def lo = HighestAll(if bn == currentBar then low else na);
AddChartBubble(bn == CurrentBar + barsFromNow, lo, +KeyEvent + " Evt \n" 
+Round(ADX(),0) +" ADX\n" +Volume() +" Vol \n", Color.Light_Gray, 0);
All values are showing as N/A
12:41 MTS1: Is "day" defined?
12:41 Nube: !IsNaN(close[8]) and IsNaN(close[7])
12:42 Nube: bj, the values are showing na because there are no values in the expansion area.
12:42 MTS1: nor is keyevent defined?
12:44 MTS1: Start troubleshooting the location of hte bubble by just using "test" for the text; then add in the text syntax once the locatoin is correct? Text syntax can be tested with a label also.
12:44 Nube: Yeah, not sure what's up there. Either way he will have to make whatever value recursive and then Bob's his uncle
12:45 bkstrader: Nube I understand that . I tried to use (0)  and [bn] to define current value. That;'s the part I don't know how to do . Key event is a variable I defined. The bubble will show on the current bar but I don't know how to define it in the expansion area
12:45 bkstrader: MTS  The bubble shows where it is supposed to but the variable values show as n/A
12:46 MTS1: Then the bubble locatoin is not the issue? Seems like you're saying it is corect but not in the expansion area which is contradictory. Can't troubleshoot the variable values without the rest of the script if the only issue is the text displayed.
12:49 Nube: keyevent[8]
12:49 bkstrader: I tested the values in that snippet with a bubble on the current bar and they show up fine. I can't figure out how to reference the currnt value in the expansion area is that possible ?
12:49 TICKZ: bkstrader is that a adx studie?
12:50 Nube: Make keyevent recursive or index it back at least as many bars as you have moved the bubble forward.
12:50 bkstrader: Tickz I have the TOS Code for ADX in a larger script
12:51 TICKZ: just asking..i have a couple i picked up here..
12:51 TICKZ: was wondering if you need..
12:52 bkstrader: Nube I tried ADX [-8] and that didn't work  not sure what I need to do differently
12:52 TICKZ: http://tos.mx/vlwmX1# adx
12:52 TICKZ: http://tos.mx/jjW8aT# adx
12:52 TICKZ: http://tos.mx/6LkSkx# adx
12:53 bkstrader: Tick Thanks but ADX is not the problem its referenceing current bar in the expansion area
12:53 TICKZ: oh ok
12:54 TICKZ: http://tos.mx/3MrTfG# psar
12:55 JohnnyQuotron: bks... when you scripted the fool proof x axis addchart bubble did it paint in the proper place?
12:56 Nube: bk, that's 8 in the wrong direction.
12:56 Nube: That's 8 forward from where you have the bubble, you want 8 back.
12:58 bkstrader: JohnnyQ The scipt from the library works fine fine . I modified it with new lines and my variables theat's when I get the N/A
12:59 bkstrader: Nube If the bububble is 8 bars in expansion isn't current ADX [-8] from the bubble ?
13:00 JohnnyQuotron: minus sign is future.  Trust Nube.. Nube knows math
13:00 JohnnyQuotron: bks.if the bubble is in the future you need to access the value from the past
13:01 bkstrader: Tried ADX [8] still n/a
13:02 Nube: bk, how hard would it be to delete the minus sign and try it.
13:03 bkstrader: Just did Nube no luck
13:03 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current.
13:05 JohnnyQuotron: Question.. has anyone scripted a scan for the Gaussian Self Adjusting RSI Laguerre with FE?  I will try if not.
13:09 JohnnyQuotron: bks.  trouble shoot.. try a bubble with just the adx...  then try another with just the other variable data one by one  create debug labels for each bit of variable data you want in the bubble.  
13:09 Nube: bk, did you use the incorrect syntax that is in the post at :03?
13:09 JohnnyQuotron: Is the bubble in the proper xy location?
13:10 anees: hello , is there a way to get the floor pivot points, i get the pre programmed pivots and they arent accurate thanks
13:10 Nube: If you use the correct syntax and index the y value back the same distance you index the x value, you will have data
13:10 JohnnyQuotron: anees check mobius my trade or the community one note
13:11 anees: where is that
13:12 JohnnyQuotron: View Only Link for the browser enabled version of the thinkScript Community OneNote
https://1drv.ms/u/s!AnkeHrrRM_cvgxQTl1xckINYlKhZ
13:12 JohnnyQuotron: for mobius mytrade right click on his name and view user's profile
13:13 bkstrader: Thanks JohnnyQ, That's where I'm headed The bubble is in the right location. I was hoping with the skills in this room there might be quick. Time to roll up the sleeves tonight
13:13 bkstrader: Nube That gives me anothe direction to try
13:14 JohnnyQuotron: debug the variables one at a time in the bubble. Trust Nube
13:14 bkstrader: JQ I know , Nube has helped may times in the past
13:15 anees: i dont get what i am supposed to do here
13:15 anees: but thank you
13:15 JohnnyQuotron: anees
13:15 JohnnyQuotron: which method
13:15 JohnnyQuotron: which source
13:16 anees: i dont know all i know its called floor pivot points , i saw they were pretty accurate and wanted to ask if they are available for tos because i already have them on DAS
13:17 JohnnyQuotron: are you in the onenote?
13:17 JohnnyQuotron: are you in mobius mytrade?
13:17 anees: yeah
13:18 JohnnyQuotron: which
13:18 anees: one note
13:19 JohnnyQuotron: support resistance section?
13:19 anees: ok
13:20 anees: oh i see them
13:20 JohnnyQuotron: 2. Pivot Scripts... there are 30 of them  Floor Trader Pivots may be a place to start
13:21 anees: yeah im gonna try all of them
13:21 anees: thank you so much
13:21 JohnGalt82: Hi - Wondering if this is built in TOS or has been shared.  Looking to plot swing lines that cross back and forth over a moving average
13:21 JohnnyQuotron: that's what its there for.  Hope you find what ou want. :)
13:22 anees: thanbks johnny appreciate it pal
13:22 JohnnyQuotron: may the code be with you...
13:30 sugar: does anyone know how to use the scan for donchian? I want to scan the ATRSX with close? or send me a copy of the scan.

13:34 JohnnyQuotron: oops my mistake.. those are strategies.. duh
13:34 sugar: johnnyquotron: it's ok you are already helping me out- so ithere a way?
13:35 Mobius: Johnny - There's an RSI Laguerre in MyTrade. The Gaussian version won't scan - Too Complex
13:35 Mobius: RSI Laguerre Scan in MyTrade
13:35 sugar: Mobius: can you send me the RSI Laguerre scan?
13:36 Mobius: no go get it from MyTrade
13:36 sugar: Mobius: where do you get mytrade?
13:37 sugar: Mobius: is that in think & swim?
13:37 Mobius: Right click ANY uers name and go the profile.
13:37 JohnnyQuotron: Mobius.. yes i have that and use it.  But with many etfs and S&P500 stocks i find the gaussian keeps me in the trade longer.    I'm a huge fan. Wonder if it will scan without the FE component?
13:37 Mobius: nope Johnny it will not
13:41 sugar: Mobius & Johnnyquontron: can I run a scan with donchain (ATRSX) with close?
13:43 JohnnyQuotron: mobius... bummer bummer bummer
13:47 Mobius: Johnny - This will scan.
Something in the scanner has changed since I wrote the original. It wouldn't scan then but I just checked and doesn now.

13:48 Mobius: 8 returns on the S&P 500
13:49 Mobius: Well that would make a couple thousand TOS traders happy to know.
13:53 JohnnyQs_BackupWks: YOU THE MAN !
13:57 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current.  Thank you Mobius and thank you ToS for updating those scan servers. Wahoo...
13:58 bsinks: This has most likely been asked a bazillion times and if so I'm sorry..........Does any body have a link for a good HOD MOMO scanner for TOS
13:58 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - last time that was shared, it had Nfe of 8, Glenght of 13, BetaDev of 4. Now it is configured 5, 13, 8.
Any specific reason for the change. Symbol used on? aggregation period?
14:02 Mobius: Alpha... Just the way I used it last is all
14:02 chief: sugar, this should work as Donchian buy scan....
input length = 50;
plot buy = high > Highest(high[1], length);
14:04 AlphaInvestor: Thanks mobius - the shape and crossing times change of course - I think this is agreat study, one of the best you have done ... so always interested in how/why it works the way it does.
P.S. the math is beyond me
14:07 Mobius: Alpha.. The latest one I've been working on uses an error correction neuron to set the length for the gaussian filter and RSI time factor. Pretty cool.
14:07 AlphaInvestor: oooh, super cool
14:08 AlphaInvestor: I am short a few physical neurons, so software ones are always beneficial
14:08 Mobius: I'll post it when I'm sure it's working correctly
14:08 AlphaInvestor: Great, thanks!
14:08 AlphaInvestor: If yoiu need beta testers ...
14:08 Mobius: I'm sure the group will have a ball twisting and morphing it :)
14:09 bigworm: neuron?
14:09 AlphaInvestor: I rarely touch your studies, except to change the lipstick, or add debug statement so that I can understand how they work
14:10 Mobius: lol  go back to sleep big... 
14:10 ramesh2599: Is it possible to displaly dynamic vertical line  50 bars back?
14:10 AlphaInvestor: yes
14:11 AlphaInvestor: why, would be an appropriate question tho
14:12 MTS1: Ramesh; use barnumber() function and do the math to determine where 50 bars back is. Or index like IsNan(close)[-50]
14:13 Mobius: Quite a bit of /ES volume swapping hands today with no real movement.
14:13 ramesh2599: I am looking into its relationship with  RSI
14:13 Mobius: let me save you some time - There is no relationship with current RSI and RSI 50 bars back
14:14 MTS1: Ramesh; which relationship with RSI?
14:14 ramesh2599: ok
14:15 Mobius: Other than the Butterfly Effect
14:15 MTS1: But 48 bars may work;)
14:15 ramesh2599: 49 to be exact!
14:15 ramesh2599: Thank you all though!!
14:16 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - that is too simplistic - they will both be between 0 and 100
14:16 bigworm: lol i wasnt sleeping.  been up since 6!! had class today to learn about the kernel trick!!!
14:17 bigworm: seems very useful.  I have been looking at code on classifiers and it seems there are alot of ones that are iterative and you need lots of loops.  with kernels, it appears you only need to go over it once
14:17 bigworm: so computationaly, it appears much more effiecient and easy to swap out
14:17 Mobius: You turned left on your way to Walmart last night and because you didn't turn right an accident happened in Russia that killed the one person that could have saved the planet 40 years from now. But the one person that would save the planet 39 years from now was born because if the same turn you made last night.  True Story. 
14:18 bigworm: lol what?
14:19 Vimes: JD?
14:20 Vimes: i thinke he's illustrating the butterfly effect
14:20 bigworm: great movie
14:22 Mobius: String Theory, Chaos Theory, Quantum Entanglement - Spooky Action at a Distance, whatever everything is connected
14:22 bigworm: agree
14:24 Vimes: is it simlar to the kevin bacon theory
14:24 bigworm: mmm
14:24 AlphaInvestor: I know a guy named Kevin, and I like bacon
14:24 Mobius: ohhh bacon...yum
14:26 Mobius: Did you guys read about the kid that just proved that quantum computers are actually doing quantum stuff?
14:26 AlphaInvestor: bacon infused jack daniels - its a thng ... look it up
14:26 Vimes: i've had bacon in bloody mary's , <-_ not ashamed
14:27 bigworm: whats going on with your brain right now
14:27 Mobius: hmm a breakfast idea
14:27 bigworm: quantum bacon stuff?
14:27 mthfr_vaxxed: urmila mahadev?
14:27 Mobius: yep   grad student
14:27 bigworm: lol
14:27 Mobius: smart girl
14:27 Mobius: she will make a difference
14:28 Mobius: TOS needs to hire her  :)
14:28 bigworm: when will they be out?
14:28 bigworm: probably will be too expensive for me
14:29 Mobius: First Quantum Trading Platform.. You guys paying attention
14:29 Vimes: i think i'm in love
14:29 bigworm: im not quick enough to even use a regular computer that efficiently
14:31 Mobius: I loved one of the illustrations used to describe a core problem with understanding what a quantum computer is doing. One with 100 qbits held in a single state would take a current harddrive the size of the visible universe to hold it's state data.  
14:33 Mobius: How could any human know if that data is correct??
14:34 mthfr_vaxxed: "Mahadev's protocl is unlikely to be implemented in a real quantum computer in the immediate future. For the time being, the protocol requires too much computing power to be practical."
14:34 Mobius: That young woman found a way... That is cool!
14:34 mthfr_vaxxed: sounds like an expensive "trust" function ....
14:35 Mobius: trust isn't an option
14:35 Mobius: Not unless you thing the Terminator would be a nice buddy
14:36 Mobius: think
14:38 NUG: Since TOS changed the futures symbols, I'm wondering if it is possible to use wildcards in thinkscript to compare with the results of the getSymbol() function??
14:38 Mobius: Why wonder. Use Addlabel and find out
14:38 Vimes: terminator 2, i think he was a nice buddy, been a while though
14:39 NUG: For example: current code is if getSymbol() == "/ES:XCME"
14:39 John1a: Does anyone have a script for the Std Channel in TOS that changes the channels color (green, yellow, red) depending on a trend, up, down, neutral. Thank you.
14:39 NUG: can I use if getSymbol() == "/ES*" ?
14:40 AlphaInvestor: Nug - you can use it, but I don't hink it will work any more
14:41 NUG: belly laugh
14:41 NUG: then why use it?
14:41 NUG: wish they'd leave shit alone
14:42 Vimes: i thought it was an exchange thing
14:42 bigworm: when did you stop teaching formally mobius
14:43 NUG: well, then they should code a routine to change the exchange requirements to the old TOS symbols so our code still works
14:50 NUG: Thanks anyway
14:56 AlphaInvestor: Nug - use   /ES:XCME   in your if statement
15:01 rupam: the RTD function for "/vxx18" does not work - any ideas?
15:01 rupam: i.e. RTD("tos.rtd",,"LAST","/VXX18") returns an error
15:02 Up_n_Up: put it on a watchlist and export it and stop futzing with the Excel side
15:02 rupam: hmm
15:03 AlphaInvestor: use      "/VXX18:XCBF"
15:05 rupam: aha! thanks...
15:09 Up_n_Up: watchlist columns that get exported somehow magically have the correct syntax, it's .... increeeedable...
15:09 chief: Never mind grad students and quantum computers. This is the headline that should get more attention  "New research suggests that climate change could trigger a global shortage of beer. " 
15:15 Taurean: Hey could somebody help me with a study as to when the Stochasitc RSI on the 5 minute chart goes above overbought or oversold and the Average line and the Value line are both greater than or less than the previous on the 30 minute chart please
15:18 Mobius: cheif - That is serious
15:20 Mobius: big.. I retired full time teaching 20 years ago. I had a grad student course up until 2 yrs ago and a couple students finishing last year.
15:20 Taurean: Hey Mobius could you give me a hand with my above statement if you dont mind?
15:21 Mobius: Taurean.. For a scan that can be done with the scan wizard easily.
15:21 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - how the heck old are you, are you in your 200's yet?
15:21 Mobius: lol  close
15:21 AlphaInvestor: retired 20 years ago, dats a long time ago
15:22 Mobius: Some of us don't wait till we're 70 to retire you know
15:23 AlphaInvestor: I dream of retiring that early
15:25 MTS1: @180???
15:25 Mobius: Alpha... There's this little thing called trading. Try that and you'll never go to an office again.  :)
15:26 AlphaInvestor: never heard tell of that kinda thing ... how would one learn how to do that?
15:27 Up_n_Up: somebody told me it was hard once
15:28 Mobius: We've traded two inside days since the "Big Red One". How often does that happen and what typically happens next?
15:29 Up_n_Up: sounds like today's pop quiz
15:35 AlphaInvestor: I would bet that the 3rd day after Big Red is not an inside day
15:35 AlphaInvestor: BUT, if I knew the answer, I might just become a trader
15:37 Taurean: Im going to put this on the 5 minute chart...can someone tell me where i went wrong?
15:38 Taurean: StochRSI("rsi length" = 10, "k period" = 10, "slowing period" = 3, "average type" = "EXPONENTIAL")."FullK" crosses below StochRSI("rsi length" = 10, "k period" = 10, "slowing period" = 3, "average type" = "EXPONENTIAL")."OverSold"
MACDTwoLines(aggregationPeriod.THIRTY_MIN)."Value" is greater than MACDTwoLines(aggregationPeriod.THIRTY_MIN)."Value" from 1 bars ago and MACDTwoLines(aggregationPeriod.THIRTY_MIN)."Avg" is greater than MACDTwoLines(aggregationPeriod.THIRTY_MIN)."Avg" from 1 bars ago
15:39 New_Trade: Mobius plese, please open teaching trading room
15:42 AlphaInvestor: Taurean - split that into 2 or more separate conditions, then use
plot Scan = cond1 and cond2 and cond3'
15:42 New_Trade: 2 inside days and VIX = 21.30....
15:42 chief: There is a small pennant on the spy which is usually a continuation pattern. Break to the downside suggests 257 spy
15:43 Nube: I support Mobius having a teaching room but only open by invite to those with the sufficient foundation and desire as determined by the Selection Committee of One.
15:45 AlphaInvestor: Nube - do you chair the SCoO?
15:45 New_Trade: but  scripting is not mandatory...   LOL
15:45 novapawshere: I cant get an alert that occurs when one moving average crosses anohter moving average to work? can someone help me figure out why this may be?
15:45 amalia: 5/29,5/30&5/31 was last InsideBar
15:46 Up_n_Up: ok ,and then what happened?
15:46 amalia: The bottoming happened and we shot up.
15:47 amalia: 4.91% up before we formed a top
15:48 AlphaInvestor: Amalia - i'm game
15:48 Nube: M does.
15:48 novapawshere: anyone willing to hlep?
15:49 AlphaInvestor: Nova - Chart Alert, Marketwatch Alert, or Dynamic Watchlist Alert?
15:49 Nube: Don't get me wrong, I'm glad we don't have that - I'd have never learned to script.
15:49 novapawshere: marketwatch alert
15:49 AlphaInvestor: so for a single symbol
15:50 novapawshere: Like i do if this moving average of 5 periods crosses this moving average of 9 periods alert me. Activates but never alerts when they do cross
15:50 novapawshere: also i do alert if 'true'
15:51 New_Trade: amalia  on 5/29 - 5/31 /ES was above 50 MA and now we below 200 MA
15:52 novapawshere: I feel like it must have something to do with the chart timeframes because  moving averages are different if your looking at a 5m vs 15m but there is no way to select one within alert options as far as i can tell
15:52 slashgw: there should be the option
15:53 novapawshere: where?
15:53 slashgw: when creating the alert
15:53 novapawshere: how confident are you in that?
15:54 slashgw: https://screencast.com/t/R5h1wzt6
15:54 novapawshere: ahh
15:55 novapawshere: i just cant find it in the options though
15:55 novapawshere: wait
15:55 slashgw: https://screencast.com/t/QewgbCq9yeo8
15:55 novapawshere: the live support guy just found it for me
15:55 AlphaInvestor: So, do you have a Study Alert something lke this:
MovingAvgCrossover(length1 = 5, length2 = 9, "crossing type" = "below")
15:55 novapawshere: yeah
15:56 novapawshere: sweet i think that will fix it
15:56 slashgw: cool. goodluck
15:56 novapawshere: thankss slashgw and alphainvester
15:56 novapawshere: you guys rock
15:56 amalia: yw
15:57 AlphaInvestor: Another satisfied ThinkScript Lounge customer
16:21 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current.  Time to heat up a few ToS Scan Farm CPUs.
16:24 JohnnyQuotron: bks.. did your bubble issue get resolved?
16:26 FrankB3:  Would someone color the background of the chart:  when the pink line is over the blue>> green,  and when th blue line is over the  pink >> red,, thanks      http://tos.mx/Thr0JJ#
16:28 Nube: AssignBackgroundColor ()
16:29 FrankB3:   Do I have to first marry the two scripts to normalize them ??
16:33 Nube: If they aren't on the same script, yes.
16:37 FrankB3:   Really not a good idea,,, thanks any way....  Mr. Mo's  script close enough for ship yard work::      http://tos.mx/CeOe8E#
16:41 DSF_TX: Could someone help me with a script for a scan .  I want to scan for the 8 ema to be above the 34 ema for 21 days or more.
16:41 DSF_TX: I was able to write the script without the timeframe.  but want to add the 21 day timeframe.
16:42 AlphaInvestor: Combining a Momentum indicator .. and a Choppiness indicator, and looking for where they cross ... hmmm
16:42 AlphaInvestor: share what you have
16:43 FrankB3: Yep,, its called RSI Lagear
16:44 FrankB3:   already been done by Mr. Mo
16:45 AlphaInvestor: Frank - good point
16:45 AlphaInvestor: I don't know that the crossover is a signal tho
16:45 DSF_TX: http://tos.mx/bbxr7t#
16:46 Vimes: def ema8 = expAverage(close,8);
def ema34 = expAverage(close,34);
plot scan = sum(ema8>ema34,21)>=21;
16:47 AlphaInvestor: showoff
16:47 Vimes: me? never
16:47 Vimes: that has about a 50% chance of working
16:48 Nube: The swing from 0 to 1 or visa versa on the LG RSI is fast enough that often it will cross .5 and OB or OS on the same bar so it's likely not a bad cross to take as a signal.
16:48 Nube: Not because the cross itself is special, but the speed makes most crosses about the same
16:49 Donnie: Do they have a screener for the mobile app? Or just the pc
16:50 Vimes: Not sure on the screener part, but i know you can save a screen based watchlist and access it via mobile
16:51 AlphaInvestor: Nube - I configure mine to cross slower ... more of an oscillator, not a yes/no signal
16:51 Nube: Ah, then that would be a different beast
16:52 AlphaInvestor: I know that Mobius likes it to be more of a signal ... because he uses it for program trading
16:53 AlphaInvestor: I prefer the gray area ... when used as an oscillator
16:54 amalia: Donnie, the built in one are pretty good and accessible on mobile. If you prefer a custom one, create one on desktop, save it under a name then you can access the screener on mobile.
16:55 amalia: *ones
17:02 Nube: There's for sure a legitimate reason to want an indication to be an on / off switch. I make my final trade decisions based on a couple of yes or no criteria so it's clear cut. But screening before I get to the yes or no stage is entirely different matter, and one I do not want switch type indicators for.
17:06 TICKZ: Im trying to make a grid to look at the global markets..but I can't find the tickers.. Can Anyone help me plz? or any Ideas?
17:13 chief: tickz...just do a googl search on country etfs
17:14 TICKZ: ok. thanks
17:15 slashgw: also look at cme futures
17:15 TICKZ: like? /6a/6b/6e etc ?
17:15 Nube: Tickz, check out the ishares website. They have ETFs for most counties in the EAFE and the EEM
17:15 slashgw: sure, currencies as well as /NKD and I'm sure there are others
17:16 slashgw: checkout their website to see what all is available
17:16 Nube: ewt, Eden, qat etc etc
17:16 TICKZ: Ok. Thanks guys!
17:25 amalia: Just trade MinRange on /YM.
17:25 mthfr_vaxxed: amalia : did you prepare?
17:26 mthfr_vaxxed: i think your one of the few who listens to my crazy anticts
17:28 amalia: =)
17:30 hguru: How do you scan on the mobile app what am o missing ?
17:32 amalia: I listen to contributors. My leaning towards shortcuts in tS comes from BLT/Mobius, long term books are similar to AlphaInvestor, my daytrading is similar to Mobius’ ORB, my curiosity behind the veil in studies from Nube, etc.
17:33 Nube: Save a scan on desktop and it will be a watchlist on mobile
17:34 hguru: Hum ok I have a bunch of watch lists
17:35 hguru: Your talking scan results becomes a watchlist I get that
17:43 MTS1: Save it as a query and it becomes a 'live' scan / watchlist that updates in mobile.
17:43 MTS1: (Don't just save the output as a watchlist)
17:44 MTS1: Those dynamic watchlists / queries have a pink symbol in front of them on desktop.
17:46 MTS1: (OR green; believe those are option hacker scans)
17:58 hguru: Hum ok thx
18:03 inov: hello..i am writing a simple study alert like below and when I receive the Alert msg, I dont get the text "SimMovAvg_Greater", instead a portion of the code is shown, can one of you help
18:03 inov: def agg = AggregationPeriod.DAY;
plot cPrice = close(period = agg);
plot savg = close > simpleMovingAvg(cPrice,20);
Alert (savg, "SimMovAvg_Greater");
18:08 TICKZ: Nube.. im using your "LABLE" script to add the countrys name.. i change the studie name..but it keeps changing other lables... can you help me plz?
18:09 TICKZ:  
18:10 Up_n_Up: inov, if the syntax is right, contact support and tell them Alert is broken
18:10 TICKZ:  
18:11 Up_n_Up: I guess the obvious question is how did you change it?
18:12 amalia: Buy /YM
18:13 TICKZ: i changed the script name for each country.. thinking it will stp changing other countrys name..
18:14 Up_n_Up: the name of the script has nothing to do with what gets displayed
18:14 Up_n_Up: lounge rule #12 - you can't have your own syntax
18:14 TICKZ:  
18:15 Up_n_Up: that will ALWAYS display Saudi Arabia, no matter what the chart, but then you know that by now
18:15 TICKZ: hah yeah
18:17 Up_n_Up: the one means always display the text string
18:18 slashgw: should be able to take a vote on the syntax one
18:18 TICKZ: I gtg... Thanks
18:18 Up_n_Up: lol slash
18:22 DMonkey: tickz....you will need to use getsymbol() aand use an if then statement....
18:25 Up_n_Up: well not really right  addlbl(getsym()=="whatever", "whatevertxt");
18:26 Up_n_Up: so much fun to make up your own syntax....   :)
18:28 amalia: lol Wish it worked like that.
19:37 John1a: Is there a way to change the color of the columns in the price ladder DOM? I've screen shots with different colors for Bis Size column and other columns, but I cannot find a setting for it. Or is it no longer an option in the current version?
19:45 DMonkey: example....this is one way to accomplish.....you pick your symbols & what you want the text to display.....
addlabel(1,if getsymbol() == "SPY" then "SPY" else if getsymbol() == "XOM" then "Exxon Mobile" else "" + getsymbol());
19:48 admin_tculs: thinkScript Lounge chatroom will be closing soon   Please finish all conversations by 8pm ct   Have a nice evening
19:50 DMonkey: gn
