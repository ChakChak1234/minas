15:54 amalia: lol
15:54 streetglide: Ford and GE leading the markets
15:55 RandomDan: I sold off my remaining GE today. probably a mistake
15:56 streetglide: depending on your time horizon maybe
16:00 DrHouse: Positions improved since my last rant
16:01 amalia: Hope so
16:02 TnT: all have a good evening
16:05 DrHouse: Cya
16:05 amalia: Laters, TnT.
16:06 GraceGu: Hi , may I ask  your comments if TOS has the indice for Smart money flow chart? Thanks, 
16:06 amalia: Grace, do you have a link to the prospectus?
16:07 GraceGu: no
16:07 amalia: It would help.
16:08 amalia:  827 was BuySignal, fwiw.
16:08 ameriman: Grace what is the index for smart money flow?
16:09 GraceGu: yeah, I think the chart as you showed
16:09 GraceGu: it is what I want
16:09 GraceGu: would you mind to let me know how can I get the chart? I have no idea
16:09 amalia: lol 
16:10 amalia: GraceGu, i would contact support@thinkorswim.com and ask for a platform tour. Before the tour, I would write down at least 10 questions/inquiries and just have them show you everything, from top to bottom, inside and out.
16:11 GraceGu: that will be great, i appreciate !
16:11 ameriman: Grace you can call them also 866-839-1100
16:11 amalia: You're welcome. You can also call them at 866-839-1100
16:12 amalia: ameriman is the guru here. Ask him anything
16:12 GraceGu: yes, i can talk to them , thank you guys so much
16:12 amalia: =) 
16:15 tmoney20g: i'm back
16:21 amalia: THANK GAWDDDD
16:23 tmoney20g: srsly
16:23 tmoney20g: what would you do w/o me
16:24 amalia: lol
16:46 GraceGu: @amalia  Hi Amalia, I just talked to the support team, and was told  " there would not be any studies or pictures like that found on the prospectus"
16:47 GraceGu: i show them the picture for easy understanding
16:51 M-C-M: hi guys, i wonder if you encountered ever this issue. On ToS active trader, i cant drag the sell order up or down once i got a partial filling, the system says that can not safely calculate the amount of the remained shares... i chated ToS rebooted the app but still nothing, it does same thing. TY
16:54 amalia: GraceGu, I think our signals crossed earlier. That picture was not in any way a reference to your inquiry.
16:55 M-C-M: SO EVERYTIME I GOT PARTIAL FILLING I HAVE TO CANCEL THE ORDER, RECALCULATE REMAINed shares and put another one, not only frustrating but i lose pretious timemost of times losing money with this when i need speed selling by draging the sell order down
16:55 amalia: M-C-M, the complaint department can be reached at support@thinkorswim.com or by dialing 866-839-1100
16:56 M-C-M: i did, they rebooted my app but nothing, tired of starting disscussions again, i thought any of you had same issu, eventually i ll call again
16:57 amalia: Nope. Nothing on my end.
17:00 GraceGu: Is that a special access requirement to prospectus? I am trying to find it from website, but failed as well. so not sure if you can give me the link so I can have a study . thanks
17:25 mthfr_vaxxed: anyone short supermicro at the beginning of this month?
17:40 amalia: G60, outside links are NOT allowed.
17:40 amalia: Especially of another chat room.
17:58 RandomDan: anybody around?
17:58 TheOnceAndFuture: Eyoo
18:00 chenmannmobile: hey dan
18:01 RandomDan: hey chen
18:01 chenmannmobile: wild day ...haha
18:01 RandomDan: hey theonce
18:01 chenmannmobile: soh me
18:01 RandomDan: very wild
18:02 chenmannmobile: came way back but still ended down, and futures r down now
18:02 RandomDan: I complained I was bored yesterday, so I guess this is what I wanted!
18:02 chenmannmobile: ha
18:03 RandomDan: not a lot of conviction in the AH drop tho
18:04 chenmannmobile: u think this was a retest or still going lower?
18:04 chenmannmobile: no idea me
18:04 RandomDan: I think there won't be a major down move tomorrow. Too dangerous while goog earnings are pending
18:05 chenmannmobile: ya true lot of er coming up
18:05 RandomDan: at least for fang and fang followers
18:05 chenmannmobile: they sold off nflx, so fwiw
18:05 RandomDan: being short fang right now is a lottery ticket
18:06 RandomDan: they did, but it took a couple of days
18:06 RandomDan: if you shorted ahead of it, you got killed
18:07 RandomDan: the IV on goog options is unbelievable
18:08 RandomDan: it's going to evaporate, one way orthe other
18:11 chenmannmobile: i would ve feel a lot better if we came back all the way with green close, but still down so kinda lean towards the bear side still
18:12 ameriman: yea test of lows was on heavy volume
18:12 ameriman: expect a retest some time in future
18:13 chenmannmobile: i saw a big sell program when es broke 2698, looking back think that was just algos clearing stops, i guess there were a lots of stops below 2700
18:14 ameriman: yea 2700 has now become a very strong level
18:14 ameriman: PPT comes in every time at 2700
18:15 chenmannmobile: just crazy big range , 50 on es today, wow
18:16 chenmannmobile: and pot and tsla lead the come back, lol ,
18:16 chenmannmobile: beaver leading
18:16 chenmannmobile: lol
18:17 chenmannmobile: but again, didnt finish the job, gave it up at the close
18:17 ameriman: TLRY almost touched 100
18:18 chenmannmobile: i know, i saw but hesitated
18:18 chenmannmobile: it was fast anyway, right at the open so not sure could ve gotten filled
18:18 RandomDan: I was tempted but my no pot play policy still stands
18:18 Edwinsnts: What do you guys think about nvcn
18:19 Edwinsnts: With consolidation today
18:19 ameriman: This room has a no penny policy
18:19 RandomDan: no idea
18:20 Edwinsnts: With consolidation today
18:20 RandomDan: oh it's a penny? yep, no pennies in the lounge
18:20 ameriman: all the penny players here blew their accounts already and left
18:24 chenmannmobile: tos should have an overnight trading room
18:26 amalia: mhm
18:26 chenmannmobile: nqfomo came back today
18:26 chenmannmobile: lol
18:26 amalia: They used to leave the rooms open when we used to control the chats properly by ourselves.
18:27 amalia: Ah, that's nice.
18:27 chenmannmobile: every time market s about to crash he makes an appearence
18:27 amalia: haha
18:27 chenmannmobile: lol
18:27 chenmannmobile: no idea on market
18:28 chenmannmobile: nqfomo
18:28 chenmannmobile: just checking
18:28 chenmannmobile: ha
18:34 KyleTrader: Can I get someone’s opinion? I bought ivitf stock at an average of 1.39 as a long term holding. At least until January as these stocks are very seasonal. I may hold for years. Am I completely screwed on this stock?
18:36 amalia: No, KyleTrader.
18:37 KyleTrader: I was looking historically it has always bounced but I was a little nervous. @amalia
18:40 Trade_Options: KyleTrader-  It's a bit below LT support but based on the candles, MM might be taking out stops.   Just know when you're exiting.  
18:41 RandomDan: 
18:42 KyleTrader: Ok. Thank you so much it won’t be the end of the world if I lose the money but I just wanted a second opinion. I think it will bounce but sometimes it gets in your head when your down every day. I appreciate your analysis. @trade_options.
18:43 amalia: You're welcome.
18:43 RandomDan: BTW I just had a UI thought. Colors should not be just green or red, should gradually shift from deep red, to red, to orange, light orange, gray, pale green, green, deep green
18:43 Trade_Options: Kyle-  No worries, that's what we're here for. . .
18:44 KyleTrader: Thank you so much everyone. I appreciate it. The mm could be trying to scare everyone out for sure. I’ve held strong and averaged down through the beating. I have a 1.39 average with a hold time of 6 months to many years.
18:45 RandomDan: One thing tgat irks me is that the colors kind of change your mood, but not in an accurate way. If everything is down just a little, your screen goes all red. That's not right.
18:45 Trade_Options: Kyle-  It's always good to have a spec play. . . best of luck.
18:46 Trade_Options: Random-  Maybe you need to get a different shade of glasses.
18:46 amalia: Laters
18:46 ameriman: Kyle my sincere advice to you will be to avoid trading penny stocks
18:46 KyleTrader: Thanks a lot. Kinda like owning regn in the day. I knew over time there would probably be 50 percent drops and rises. Marijuana plays are always volatile.
18:47 Trade_Options: gn amalia
18:47 KyleTrader: I’ve always bought a variety of different things. This is my spec play. It may win it may lose but I’ll fight to trade another day. @ameriman.
18:49 FunPilot: Evening all.
18:49 ameriman: Kyle why even trade something that has huge edge against you? Thousands of better opportunities out there
18:50 tmoney20g: HMNY ?
18:50 FunPilot: Anyone know the best way to to search asset classes and sub classes like, Domestic, Internation, Fixed Income, Equity and such?
18:51 Trade_Options: ameriman-  You are 100% correct, but everyone has their own agenda.  
18:52 Trade_Options: Trading is as individual as the person.   That's what I like about it.
18:53 FunPilot: That is SO true
18:53 KyleTrader: Right. I figured that taking a risk on something like this early on would be no riskier than investing in alcohol during prohibition. If I’m wrong I lose the money life goes on, if I’m right the amount to be made could be huge.
18:56 tmoney20g: half my family was bootleggers, the other half were federal agents
18:56 tmoney20g: go figure
18:56 Trade_Options: Kyle-  When I trade options (long), I enter the trade fully expecting to lose all my $$.  That's the spec, so you need to have that thought nailed down.  It's just when you stay with that one play, then you'll get into trouble.
18:57 KyleTrader: Trouble? @trade_options
18:57 Trade_Options: Or style, ie penny plays.  You'll need to grow & learn from your trades.
18:58 Trade_Options: Trouble, as in defining winning only with penny stocks.   I have at least one in every account as a reminder of my bad decisions.  Thats all.
18:59 KyleTrader: Understood.
19:00 Trade_Options: brb.  Cats hungry.
19:00 KyleTrader: Thank you so much!
19:02 Trade_Options: NP Kyle.  I've been tradng a long time.  Made a lot of money and lost a lot of money.  Best thing is I'm better off than when I started because of higher net worth and learning along the way.   
19:02 Trade_Options: brb
19:02 tmoney20g: i'm winning megabillions tonight, so tomorrow should be fun
19:08 cajun: tmoney, i am too tonite.  
19:08 Trade_Options: yeah me too.  Got my 12 sets of number, gotta be a winner in there somewhere = ]
19:09 FunPilot: Shoot I wish I was.  It is ladies night out so the wife gets all the fun tonight.
19:09 cajun: ;-))
19:14 Trade_Options: When's the drawing?  After the evening news?
19:14 tmoney20g: 11pm est
19:15 Trade_Options: Ok so at the end of the late news.
19:15 tmoney20g: depending where you are, sure
19:16 Trade_Options: I'm CST but same difference.
19:16 Trade_Options: I normally don
19:16 tmoney20g: i personally give no chits, i'll check mine in like a month
19:16 Trade_Options: 't buy tickets but the odds are favorable for a winner
19:16 tmoney20g: unless they say "there's a missing ticket for the winner from Ventnor Wawa"
19:16 tmoney20g: then it *could* be me
19:17 tmoney20g: i can't believe how flat NQ is
19:18 Trade_Options: Ah the "WaWa."    
19:18 tmoney20g: well, until 15 minutes ago anyway
19:18 tmoney20g: too bad they're not publicly traded
19:18 tmoney20g: i'd def buy in
19:20 Trade_Options: My gal is from NJ, she intoduced me on our last trip to the coast.  Very suprised at the "cult" mindset regarding wawa.
19:20 Trade_Options: I'd agree with you on the buy in.   
19:28 tmoney20g: very cult
19:28 tmoney20g: like the highest daily loyalty of any sort of store on the plane
19:28 tmoney20g: planet
19:29 tmoney20g: like you might go to mcd's for bfast on saturday
19:29 tmoney20g: or you might order pizza every friday night
19:29 tmoney20g: but EVERY MORNING you go to wawa
19:31 tmoney20g: where in nj she from ?
19:33 Trade_Options: Cherry Hill area
19:37 tmoney20g: i'm near there
19:37 tmoney20g: halfway between philly and ac
19:37 tmoney20g: i work in ac
19:39 Trade_Options: Camdon, forgot CH was where we stayed.  Home of Subaru USA (big fan)
19:40 Trade_Options: Watched Board Walk so had to see AC. . . 
19:43 tmoney20g: boardwalk empire ?
19:43 tmoney20g: so earlier when i said half my family was bootleggers, and the other half was federal agents
19:43 tmoney20g: my grandmother's brother was the us marshall that arrested nucky

06:31 blondetrader: I have 67.4 so we r spot on
06:32 blondetrader: based on yest close which was a confluence of weekly and monthly....if the low was any good price should test 68.6ish at some point in next day or 3
06:32 invertedhammer: Missed long fill at 66.4 earlier so not chasing

07:07 featherweight: Woof got out of GCs in time
07:10 efu: es  no look good
07:13 Jonchew38: Dow futures pointing to a positive open - probably on back of BA earnings beat. But will the broader market be lifted up?
07:14 efu: senior, senior, your britches are tore, you better go home and get you some more , senior
07:14 blondetrader: based on dly momo we should have another day-2 sideways to down
07:14 blondetrader: but that is not to say momo HAS to complete the cycle so for es :52 is key
07:15 radon224: I predict 2 days of staring at the screen saying "WTF??"
07:15 blondetrader: any close over 58 suggests that for now bottom in

07:17 blondetrader: or splat
07:17 Jonchew38: the narrative from companies when they do the reporting would be impt
07:18 Jonchew38: in guiding expectations going forward
07:18 blondetrader: yep
07:18 blondetrader: gc as mentioned yesterday has a compelling sell up around 50-55
07:18 blondetrader: if the support holds that would be the next get
07:19 Jonchew38: i am bearish - think fed may be behind the curve - if tariff results in higher costs down the road... fed may be forced to hike more

08:04 tmoney20g: for the most efficient trading, yes
08:04 tmoney20g: multiple windows, larger charts, etc

08:46 tmoney20g: seems like it
08:46 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: lol
08:46 tmoney20g: waiting for lows around 1030-11
08:46 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: that was an interesting V bottom reversal  yesterday!
08:47 tmoney20g: problem is, there's no reason to bounce off a bottom right now
08:47 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: straight up off a low, with no daily retest!
08:47 tmoney20g: what dreams are made of
08:47 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: lol
08:48 stockhawk: CWST IN @ 31.08
08:49 stockhawk: tsla bearish 3 rd lower high from seemed like a fake triple bottom
08:49 tmoney20g: 7080 test coming
08:49 tmoney20g: think it'll break right thru
ADXCrossover()
17:21 amalia: The manual is a great start.
17:24 daybuck: Im sure it probably would be for someone that knows how to code but I cant even translate the code I want converted
17:31 amalia: If it's making you money, it's a worthy endeavor to start learning.
17:31 amalia: Else contact someone outside of the chatroom by other means than soliticing in here and pay them to do it for you.
17:32 daybuck: TDA told me this was the place to ask for help
17:36 amalia: You may have better luck coming back tomorrow during regular trading hours and see if anyone wants to help you. Converting is above my paygrade. What's the study? It's probably already in thinkScript.
17:38 daybuck: This is the script...It is pivot points on different timeframes
17:38 amalia: Don't paste it!
17:39 amalia: Stop!
17:39 amalia: Confirm please
17:39 amalia: daybuck!!!
17:39 daybuck: yes
17:39 amalia: Before we get to anything about code or sharing anything...
17:39 amalia: What's it called?
17:39 amalia: What's it do?
17:41 daybuck: As I said before, it is pivot points on different time frames. I dont know what else to tell you
17:43 MTS1: how are the pivots detemined?  I assme you looked at the built-in ones? 
17:44 amalia: daybuck?
17:45 daybuck: yes
17:46 amalia: Can you answer some of the questions we've provided?
17:46 amalia: daybuck, keep up or else we're moving on.
17:49 daybuck: amalia, I have answered the best I know to answer. I don't code so maybe your questions are over my head. I came here for help and nobody has even asked to see the code. Maybe if you look at it you can answer your own questions, unfortunately, I can't
17:50 daybuck: MTS1, the built in ones move on a daily basis. This code doesn't move on a daily timeframe
17:50 MTS1: So what timeframe does it move on?
17:50 amalia: See? There's one answer.
17:51 daybuck: Monthly and weekly
17:51 amalia: Don't limit yourself. You must be able to describe what you trade. We can start by the name...
17:52 MTS1: Most of the built-in ones have settings for that.
17:53 MTS1: Do you know how your script calculates the pivots? Is it using a standard method like the built-in ones or something special?
17:53 daybuck: amalia, explain your question...what do I trade. Not sure what difference it makes
17:54 MTS1: Amalia must have had a bad day; we'd like people to stick around and answer clarification questions and be as specific as they can be.
17:54 amalia: I'm here inquiring and asking questions. I must not care. lol
17:54 daybuck: Guys, don't ask me questions about the script. I cant explain it. Seems it would be much simpler to look at it.
17:54 amalia: daybuck, coders are anal. My bad if you're reading tension through text. Far from the truth.
17:54 amalia: Go ahead then.
17:55 MTS1: OK DayBreak; take a step back then: If you're trading using pivots that you don't understand you may want to revisit your trading plan?
17:55 amalia: There's the disconnect for me. "...don't ask me questions about the script. I can't explain it"
All I hear is, "I don't know how to use this study I want converted."
17:56 amalia: I'm just telling you my thought process. Don't take it personal.
17:56 daybuck: I know how to trade it on another platform but would rather have it on TOS. It just that simple
17:57 amalia: Share the script, daybuck.
17:57 MTS1: you should understand the logic behind the pivots or where they are derived / calculated from; I assume they are not random lines to you. My guess is the built-in ones do what you want already or can be a start, unless you can explain / show how your pivots are calculated differently.
17:58 mcdon0301: hi.  i put a moonphase script together( I know hocus pocus), but having issues. would anyone care to take a look? http://tos.mx/rQvJJd#
17:59 amalia: mcdon0301, here you go
http://tos.mx/J2Xh4V#
17:59 MTS1: There are at least 4 built-in pivot scripts that have slight variations how they are calculated, that all have inputs for day, week, month, or more.
18:00 daybuck: I cant even get it to paste up
18:01 amalia: daybuck, please exit and re-enter the room.
18:01 amalia: daybuck, go to pastebin.com and after you've loaded the code there, share the link here.
18:01 daybuck: ok
18:03 mcdon0301: that was fast.
18:03 MTS1: Suspect it is not the same script if you created one from scratch;)
18:04 MTS1: you can expect moonphase scripts to have issues before a full moon though; may not be your script;)
18:04 amalia: Did you even look at it? lol
18:04 amalia: nvm
18:05 amalia: -_-
18:05 mcdon0301: yes, trying to take a look
18:06 MTS1: I know Alpha has one too; ask him next time he's arround. He's proud off that one!
18:09 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current but for the gap from the open until 8:56am.  Dinner bell''s ringing.  Later gators...
18:14 amalia: Room, I need help as well...
18:15 amalia: I've made a MinRange for Intraday, Weekly and Monthly. Now trying to come up with a Yearly one. This one's mainly for coding practice but seem to be stuck
18:20 FunPilot: Afternoon all.  Crazy day in the market.
18:20 FunPilot: But a decent ending.
18:21 MTS1: What's the problem Amalia?
18:22 MTS1: Fun; that was NOT a fun ending for me. .
18:23 daybuck: amalia, hope this works :https://pastebin.com/RNx5vcWG
18:24 FunPilot: Sorry man.  I lost too, just not as much.  Just trying to look at the positive.
18:26 amalia: MTS1, looking through daybuck's link, looks like a HL3 on MTF?
18:26 amalia: Ok, going back to where I'm stuck...
18:27 amalia: daybuck, the code you shared, is there an author?
18:28 daybuck: I hope that wasn't a trick question....!
18:29 amalia: Someone wrote the script. Characters and syntax didn't just appead. Do you know who did?
18:29 daybuck: Im sure there is but its thru a 3rd party and Im not sure who wrote it. Sorry
18:29 amalia: Ah.
18:29 amalia: It's bad juju to share a script with no author.
18:29 amalia: Most here wouldn't touch it without it. Could be copyrighted, etc.
18:29 MTS1: DayBuck; so looks like standard pivot levels, no extensions? Is the 'special' thing the coloring based on SMA crossover?
18:30 FunPilot: If I may ask a dumb question, is there an easy stock screener on Thinkorswim to find asset classes and sub classes like Market Cap, Domestic, International, Fixed Income, Equity.
18:30 daybuck: All I know is JJ. Sorry
18:33 daybuck: From what I know, the only thing special is the pivot levels remain the same whereas the boxed ones on TOS move daily depending on the market. Reminds me somewhat of Darvas Boxes but......
18:34 MTS1: They do not; I already told you multiple times that you can change the input to not change daily
18:35 daybuck: They do not what MTS1?
18:35 MTS1: change every day if you don't want them to; they have inputs for the periods you wanted.
18:36 MTS1: (just like the script you shared)
18:37 daybuck: ok. Great. Now were getting somewhere. Back to my original proclamation. I dont code. So how do I mirror this script with the boxed one on TOS?
18:37 MTS1: have not seen one for periods less than day though; but does not sound like you were looking for the 8 hour pivot option.
18:40 daybuck: The idea is to trade off of an hourly chart at or near the monthly pivit (assuming some other criteria is met)
18:40 daybuck: Pivot
18:42 MTS1: Seriously Day; been saying that starting with my first responses. This has nothing to do with coding. Check out the built-in ones, read the tutorials at tlc.thinkorswim.com to get familiar with TOS, and ask support for a platform tour. Make sure you have 10 questions ready for them so they can show you the platform inside out.
18:47 daybuck: i had a platform tour 5 years ago when I started using TOS. I just never coded anything so I cant tell where the boxed one is different from what I wanted coded. All I know is that the two are different. The pivots are not the same as they are on the other platform
18:48 MTS1: When you set them to weekly or monthly they are not the same?
18:49 MTS1: Which ones did you try?
18:50 amalia: daybuck, if I can explain the whole situation here today is like going to McDonald's and giving the cashier a wet paper where the order was written in and not being able to give some sort of idea of what was originally there and expecting the cashier to be a sort of mind-reader. There's going to be a disconnect here until you can provide us with the author, link to the study/strategy with parameters/data, etc.
18:51 daybuck: Honestly, I havent tried personally. The fellow I got the code from told me when I asked that it didn't match the other platform because of the movement. He uses it on another platform. I would rather use TOS so I'm trying to convert it
18:52 daybuck: He used to use TOS
18:53 MTS1: Right when we started this whole (long) conversation you said you tried the built-in ones and that they changed daily, and I told you the built-in ones have settings for weekly and monthly when you said that's what you needed. We're full back now; why don't you try the built-in ones and see what you find.
18:54 sebastian2363: Hey, sorta new to the system here - I was wondering if any of you guys got EarningsPerShareTTM() to work. I can't even get it to plot.
18:54 amalia: 1h:35m of talking with daybuck. I tap out. GL daybuck.
18:54 amalia: Welcome sebastian2363.
18:54 daybuck: No problem. What do I change in the built in code to keep them from moving daily?
18:55 amalia: I was about to reply. lol No!
18:55 amalia: sebastian, did you try different tickers?
18:55 sebastian2363: I tried the default and "v".
18:55 MTS1: they'll give you a platform tour for free every 6 months
18:57 daybuck: This would have been much simpler if you could just not respond or admit you dont know how to answer the question
18:58 MTS1: I don't see EarningsPerShareTTM()?
18:59 sebastian2363: Its under the new "stock fundamentals" tab
18:59 MTS1: Oh; not a script?
19:00 sebastian2363: It is a script function
19:01 MTS1: daybuck; really/??? I know the answer, and so should you, we discussed them right in the beginning. It would have been much easier if you just were listening and honest / trying from the start.
19:03 MTS1: It does not seem like you've actually used TOS in the past 5 years and don't know how to add a built-in indicator? Do you know how to add a MA and change the settings? This is not a coding issue, this is PEBKAC.
19:04 amalia: I indulged you for more than a hour. MTS1 also concluded that we've gone full circle but you keep thinking otherwise. Here I am still replying back giving you the benefit of the doubt that you can somehow recover.
19:04 amalia: +1 MTS1
19:06 amalia: btw here are some of your pivots
def MonPivot = HL3(period = AggregationPeriod.MONTH);
def WeekPivot = HL3(period = AggregationPeriod.WEEK);
19:07 MTS1: Sebastian; have not played with those yet, but I'd try some different tickers.
19:07 amalia: daybuck has left the room. lol
19:08 amalia: "No one else can be right" attitude even when asking for help. smh -_-
19:09 sebastian2363: ok. thank you let me try
19:10 amalia: Room, what's a good way to collect Yearly OHLC values?
19:10 MTS1: But my indicator is special; I want it coded from scratch even if it already exists and I don't know what it does;)
19:11 MTS1: Amalia; O/C should be easy based on year change; would you want to use secondary aggregation for H/L or are you trying to keep it scanner friendly?
19:12 MTS1: H/L could be done that way also I guess based on year change; how many years back do you need though?
19:12 MTS1: Amalia; still there??? ;)
19:13 amalia: Yeah, going back and forth from Editor, chart then back here.
19:13 amalia: Funny link but this is what I have so far:
http://tos.mx/SedWed#
19:13 amalia: SedWed. lmao
19:17 MTS1: Not sure why yo have the extra if-then loop in there instead of 
def YearL = if YearChange==1 then L else if L<=YearL[1] then L else  YearL[1] ;
19:18 MTS1: but that's one way. Was thinking you wanted prior year OHLC which you could then carry forward. Or was thinking using monthly aggregation and getting highest, but this is easier.
19:19 amalia: I'm open to ideas really.
19:19 MTS1: (And the close obviously is the prior year's close).
19:19 MTS1: How are you using the values; how far back do you need OHLC, just prior year or current year?
19:20 amalia: This is what I'm trying to calculate:
def yearMinRange = Average(if YearC>=YearO then Min(YearH-YearC,YearO-YearL) else Min(YearH-YearO,YearC-YearL),10);
19:20 amalia: So I can't use Highest/Lowest cause that uses a rolling period
19:24 MTS1: are those current year values?
19:24 amalia: The ones in the label, yes.
19:24 MTS1: no hte yearMinRange def
19:24 MTS1: *the
19:25 amalia: Yes.
19:26 amalia: It's gonna be current until it's BNd I think
19:26 MTS1: Then you've got it already, except use the current close instead of tye Y one as that's last year's close.
19:27 amalia: But I'm trying to get last year's H/L. I can't use current values for calculation
19:27 fibfibfib: hey amalia, I just open your work on the yearly and it looks cool. Just a though, is it possible to include the open and closing price for yearly, monthly, quartley, weekly and daily?
19:27 MTS1: That's what I was asking;)
19:28 amalia: fibfibfib, it looks cool but it's not done yet. Will share when it's done.
19:28 fibfibfib: and on each line, add a bubble to say year open, year close...etc
19:29 MTS1: Then carry forward def PYH = if YearChange==1 then  YearO[1] else PYH[1]; ? 
19:29 MTS1: Sorry PYO in this case - PriorYearOpen; same for H/L
19:29 fibfibfib: thanks Amalia, MTS1.. im just beginning to learn so not as expert as you guys
19:30 fibfibfib: but so far, that's a very good idea to start on.
19:30 MTS1: WE NEED MORE BUBBLE (in SNL CowBell Voice)
19:32 amalia: lol
19:32 MTS1: Is that what you need Amalia, or am I missing something still?
19:33 amalia: Getting off desktop. that useless chat earlier fried my brain. gonna go get my green remedy on to get some cells back to attack this iead head on with more patience. =) MTS1, thanks for indulging
19:34 MTS1: lol, gn
19:34 amalia: =)
19:38 fibfibfib: don't go too long now, we need your brainpower. hahahaha
19:39 fibfibfib: just kidding

07:46 Mobius: http://tlc.thinkorswim.com/center/reference/thinkScript/Functions/Look---Feel/AddCloud.html
07:46 JohnnyQuotron: Good morning thinkScript Lounge.  I notice that no one has lost their sense of humor.  Excellent!
07:48 Mobius: Got over a 1% globex range on high volume with price near previous close again. Whats NOT to be excited about?
07:53 LAZY: I just copied and printed out thinkscript.  Why Wally siad it is useless in word??
07:54 LAZY: I like to meet gofast :)
07:55 eayjee: mobius, is it hard to put those parameters in a script?  the instruction page wasn't too clear
07:56 eayjee: don't mean to bother and I appreciate any help
07:58 Vimes: not sure you tried very hard: see if this works
def ema26 = expaverage(close,26);
def ema9h = expaverage(high,9)[3];
def ema9l = expaverage(low,9)[3];
addcloud(ema9h,ema26,color.green,color.yellow);
addcloud(ema26,ema9l,color.red,color.yellow);
07:59 eayjee: really appreciate that Vimes, thank you both
08:01 eayjee: that worked perfectly....thanks a lot
08:19 dokk408: anyone know if there's a way to get the implied volatility of an ATM call on the Friday following earnings?
08:20 Mobius: there's no history for series IV
08:21 dokk408: ok, thnx
08:21 Vimes: do you mean the next series?
08:21 Sorkin: Oct 29 GE $12 puts
08:22 dokk408: im trying to track the expansion of IV as earnings approaches
08:22 Vimes: Well mobius read your mind then, no history
08:24 Vimes: You could maybe estimate it from teh ImpVolatility() plot but i'm out of my element there
08:25 tarbog: hey dmonkey.  thanks for the script on day mid.  i got it on my charts yesterday and it worked well for the day session.  thanks.  really appreciate your help.
08:26 dokk408: the ImpVolatility appears to give an aggregation of several expirations
08:44 Mobius: dokk.. There's no need to guess. All the data and method for calculating IV is listed on the CBOE in a white paper.
08:45 BenP: Good Morning.  I have squeezed an intraday chart down so small that I lost the 'Time' displayed in the X axis.  Is there any code available to deliniate the change of each day with a vertical line?
08:46 Mobius: yes
08:47 dokk408: thnx Mobius.  now i just have to learn enough so i can create a script for it so display on my charts!
08:48 Mobius: dokk.. You don't need to learn to calculate it TOS has functions to display annualized IV and all the various series IV already
08:56 willie_sutton: gm all
08:56 BenP: Hi Mobius.  Was that 'yes' for me?
08:59 MTS1: Yes
08:59 MTS1: Look at AddVerticalLine() function
08:59 MTS1: or just put vertical in the left-top filter box in the reference
08:59 MTS1: (to find available functions)
09:02 MTS1: next you'll probably look in the date/time section to find the function to determine if the day changed to use in the vertical line function.
09:04 BenP: gotcha.  thanks !!
09:04 MTS1: yw
09:10 Paris: BenP - Here's an example on plotting a vertical line
# Vertical Line on New Day
# 9.17.2018
def today = getDay() == getLastDay();
addVerticalLine(today and !Today[1], "New Day", color.cyan, curve.short_dash);
09:11 Vimes: i wonder how many total mobius snippets are out there, 1000, 2000?  :) :)
09:12 Paris: I must have at least 500+ snort snippets
09:12 fibfibfib: Hi Mobius, if there a way to automatically fib measure the prior week and month?
09:12 Mobius: fibfib.. yes
09:12 fibfibfib: or does anyone know how?
09:15 Mobius: you already have the Auto Fib Study. Just change the iData to whatever higher aggregation you want
09:17 Paris: whoops, typo: snort = short. LOL!
09:17 willie_sutton: anyone found a way to plot option delta for mulpiple strikes on a lower?
09:18 Vimes: lol, didn't notice
09:18 Mobius: I prefer snort Paris... Fits me better  :)
09:18 Paris: Heh!
09:18 Vimes: a snort of jd
09:20 Mobius: willie.. that could be done as long as you don't try to  get much more than 1 or 2 strikes away from ATM
09:20 willie_sutton: Hi Mobius - that woud be fine with me
09:21 willie_sutton: I hope you're well
09:21 Mobius: then use the Options Dashboard or any of the other studies I've written for a template to get the OPRA symbols. From there you can calculate delta or get it from TOS data
09:22 Mobius: /ES is giving me that sinking feeling
09:23 Vimes: buyers just can't get it done
09:24 Mobius: looks like pros selling into any rally. Volume goes down on a rise and way up on a fall. Energy is on the down side.
09:26 Mobius: Now a days that could change in a minute. Used to be, at the first sign of energy higher going down it was a clear sign to go to a higher cash weighting or to hedge tight. Now it's just not so clearcut.
09:27 Vimes: interesting
09:27 willie_sutton: Mobius - I have been toying with some of your studies.  Here's one you might find interesting....

09:28 Vimes: i think the chemical market has become so savy on passing on formula pricing based on raws perhaps in the old days they weren't as clver
09:28 Vimes: clever
09:28 mthfr_vaxxed: Any reasons you know of why October is so gloomy usually? Black Thursday from 1929 still scaring everyone? or something else?
09:30 Mobius: mth.. There's 100 opinions about that if there's 1. Best source in my opnion is Traders Almanac
09:30 willie_sutton: I should say that I've been looking at your option dashboard as well, but I'm not sure how it works.  I'm slow as you know.  I understand that you calculated an approximate delta, but i'm unsure how that would be applied across multiple strikes.  I'll keep at it.
09:31 Vimes: externals might not stick - but a site that allows a quick view of seasonal trends
http://marketqview.com/seasonalchart.php?ID=75
09:33 Vimes: would suggest october is actually historically strong into eoy
09:41 MTS1: Willie; it would be cool if you left headers / attribution / comments in the code.
09:42 MTS1: and give it a name
09:44 willie_sutton: agreed
09:45 willie_sutton: Call it:
#it plots the bid and ask of a manually entered option.
09:47 cajun: willie, building on MTS, how bout specifying what you changed/added to mobius work
09:48 willie_sutton: apologies to all
09:50 Paris: MTS - I've annotated Willie's suggested nomenclature on my end. All good on my end
09:50 MTS1: Appreciate the sharing! Just feedback as I didn' see headers or what it does or attribution to original code / enhancements. I see you left comments in further down, but a header would be nice.
09:52 willie_sutton: all the attributions were mobius'
09:53 kjg: Hello - can anyone tell me how to add a chart to show a study only.  don't need price..
09:54 Vimes: somewhere in settings hide price
09:55 MTS1: There's a function also to do it in a script; just searched for hide in the reference; hidePricePlot()
09:57 Paris: Willie, since your posted study plots the bid/ask of a manually entered option, I have tagged your study with the following header in my archives as a placeholder.
# Bid and Ask OPRA Code
# willie_sutton
# 10.24.2018
09:57 willie_sutton: i love that
09:57 Paris: Thanks for your contribution Willie!
09:58 kjg: Vimes, MTS1 - thank you - I'll check it out
10:00 willie_sutton: I must admit that i didn't fuly understand Mobius' cloud shading; so you can add this if you like:
# for addCloud, green denotes when someone hits the ask price, red denotes hitting the bid
10:01 Paris: Noted
10:06 JohnnyQuotron: Willie... like Paris I will be adding a header to the mobius script you altered.  Please, where ever possible add an authorship header to your scripts and if you are adjusting someone else's code comments regarding the changes are particularly helpful.  Mobius code is considered the "Gold Standard" and relied upon without hesitation..  if you are adjusting his code, particularly his logic or math, it is critical that those looking at your script next week or next year know where it deviated from the "Gold Standard".  Thank you.
10:17 DMonkey: gm.....

10:17 JohnnyQuotron: Morning D
10:18 willie_sutton: Sorry johnny, I'm new here
10:20 Nube: Traders Almanac is a great book to the get the hamster wheel spinning.
10:30 JohnnyQuotron: willie... no need to be sorry.  I apologize if I came of as being gruff.  I'm glad you're here and contributing.  I'm just thinking about a Community OneNote reader looking at your script six months from now.  If you haven't visited the Community OneNote here is the public link    https://1drv.ms/u/s!AnkeHrrRM_cvgxQTl1xckINYlKhZ
10:32 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current.  BBL
10:32 Mobius: DMonkey - Love your naming convention in that study. So creative  :)
10:36 JohnnyQuotron: Mobius... imagine Limbo Bars using that naming convention xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
10:45 Mobius: ha.. that's be about right
10:54 amalia: whew
10:55 DMonkey: Department of Redundancy Department

10:56 amalia: MTS1, B3 kinda made it easy for me but here's the YearlyMinRange draft:
