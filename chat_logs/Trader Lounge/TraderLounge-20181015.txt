15:23 VolCrush: so bronx, don't u owe us something?
15:23 RandomDan: I think the market is set to go sideways, newsflow dependent.
15:24 blondetrader: lol
15:24 blondetrader: we didnt open 2780 so I only owe it to u
15:25 AlphaInvestor: So, WFC which missed E is up 1.3% today ... but JPM that beat E is down 1.09% today. What kinda bizarro world do we live in.
15:26 VolCrush: ok, i'll wait patiently for the "ping" on my phone

any second now, right?
15:26 blondetrader: keep watching for it
15:26 JC_chart: cuirious on rty trade
15:26 RandomDan: It's my fault Al. Fins going up as soon as I take a loss on my GS.
15:26 JC_chart: mind sharing your entry and exit and chart timeframe
15:26 RandomDan: but I don't feel like doing that
15:26 VolCrush: welp you Alpha, more than anyone here know that funnies don't mean chit with respect to how the market reacts
ergo, drop funnies
LOL
15:27 JC_chart: totally ok if you say no... just interested

15:28 blondetrader: this was not the day I expected
15:28 blondetrader: haha no
15:28 JC_chart: did you hold it thru last night?
15:28 blondetrader: I did
15:28 blondetrader: and got stopped out this am
15:28 JC_chart: holy s**
15:28 JC_chart: that's a big stop LOL
15:29 blondetrader: no lol I made $$
15:29 RandomDan: bt, really. This is exactly the day I expected... using your TA!
15:29 JC_chart: i am sure you did
15:29 JC_chart: u were short right
15:29 AlphaInvestor: Vol - with both reporting the same day, they should have reacted in relation to their E results
15:29 blondetrader: :)
15:29 JC_chart: as of yesterday afternoon
15:29 blondetrader: no i was long into this am
15:29 VolCrush: welp send me a pic wearing red soled only then...........
15:29 JC_chart: ohhh i thought you were short
15:29 VolCrush: Alpha, they did
15:29 JC_chart: it went up 25 points
15:29 blondetrader: nooo I was on for the rally pffft
15:29 blondetrader: I was looking for 95 lol
15:30 RandomDan: she was long, I remember
15:30 JC_chart: what tiemframe do you use to identify entries
15:30 blondetrader: 4 hr mostly
15:30 blondetrader: and dly
15:30 RandomDan: so what about the day didn't go as you expected?
15:30 blondetrader: well Dan I thought the pop would have more teeth
15:30 blondetrader: this was like a little kitten
15:30 blondetrader: not a lion
15:31 RandomDan: I thought it was pretty good, considering the wreckage.
15:31 blondetrader: I would not be surprised to see another wave of selling monday am b4 we get any consecutive days of green
15:31 blondetrader: dissapointing
15:32 blondetrader: but i have some scary tgts lower
15:32 RandomDan: the day was a big cup, also a positive.
15:32 blondetrader: so to avoid mkt need to do some work
15:32 VolCrush: not a bad pop actually, only because the close was vary gud on /nq
so respectfully disagree
15:32 blondetrader: nq could rally another 100
15:32 blondetrader: and still look like shit
15:32 VolCrush: or more
15:33 blondetrader: btw that would be res for leg 2
15:33 blondetrader: anything over........we good
15:33 VolCrush: well we wanna buy chit, who wants to buy gud?
15:33 blondetrader: lol yes but if nq fails that
15:33 blondetrader: you can buy it a lot cheaper
15:33 VolCrush: sell against
15:34 blondetrader: like to the tune of67s
15:34 VolCrush: true but we got pick our lines in der sand
15:34 blondetrader: figure 150 off this weeks low would be next tgt dn
15:34 blondetrader: well nq needs to hold 7112
15:34 VolCrush: i gots my names for hunting season and will fall on my sword if necessary
15:34 JC_chart: we could have some violent upswing no doubt in the indexes but I think insitutions need market to drop more so they can buy it and bid it back up like they do in every cycle
15:35 blondetrader: yes
15:35 AlphaInvestor: I think this past couple days was selling der MoMo and a rotation into Quality. MSFT, ADBE and such did very well for me when those trades were put in this week during the downturn
15:35 blondetrader: as i mentioned we have a htf bear move happening that isnt complete momo wise
15:35 blondetrader: and we have a dly oversold
15:35 VolCrush: heck i wanted 6845 on /nq, when i called 7 k /nq i got laffed out of here 
15:35 blondetrader: so would make sense to get some relif
15:35 JC_chart: yeah 6800 is the midpoint for nq for a 1Y daily chart
15:36 VolCrush: ah hah, ty @JC
15:36 JC_chart: honestly all that matters is AMZN
15:37 JC_chart: so we should just trade that as it makes up what percent of NQ ... 60 haha
15:37 VolCrush: emmmm, der fruit is a playa and mr softie is now relevant for some reason
15:37 blondetrader: 1835 needs to break amzn
15:37 blondetrader: orr 1621 lol
15:38 blondetrader: rty closed red today
15:38 blondetrader: no bueno
15:38 VolCrush: either way lots of resistance with every pop now
15:38 JC_chart: RTY is very sick on my chart
15:38 VolCrush: yah true dat, rty is a big problem atm
15:39 blondetrader: honesly
15:39 VolCrush: yes dear
15:39 blondetrader: if it has to rinse like to get it done this month
15:39 JC_chart: it trendline has been down since 9/24 and the pitch of that line is steep not much releif soon unless earning are rocking
15:39 blondetrader: like before last week of oct
15:39 VolCrush: welp u wanna see a down trend line go see XLF
15:40 blondetrader: it made a lower low today lol
15:40 JC_chart: youre right it is sicker
15:40 blondetrader: and it leads imo
15:40 blondetrader: this turned 1-2 weeks b4 the others gave it up
15:41 JC_chart: so any of you ever traded wheat futures or soybeans?
15:41 blondetrader: yep
15:42 JC_chart: you know they have nive moves in the morning
15:42 blondetrader: I do :)
15:42 Bid_Ask: what's nive
15:42 JC_chart: and they are super volatile but i was thinking i almost like them better than es
15:42 blondetrader: for sun night mon am i am really leaning on selling rty
15:42 JC_chart: you have the same payout
15:42 blondetrader: they offer minis
15:43 blondetrader: imo the trend is more true in ags
15:43 JC_chart: i was sitting in soybeans yesterday and forgot about the monthlyr eport and it ripped about 5 dollars in a nano second
15:43 blondetrader: yea got to mind those report
15:44 JC_chart: i was lucky i was long it also whipped back so i did fine but yes that was my thought exactly when i  sold the contracts LOL
15:44 blondetrader: lol
15:45 JC_chart: when you speak of trend you are speaking of trend on daily right?
15:45 blondetrader: genericly yes
15:45 blondetrader: but I prefer when all time frames are in agreement
15:46 JC_chart: me too ibut i try to just focus on one chart
15:46 JC_chart: i look at the daily 30m for trend
15:46 JC_chart: and then trade the 3 or 1m
15:46 blondetrader: oh yea thats too small for me
15:46 JC_chart: i built some indicaotrs that are multitimeframe so that helps just using one chart
15:46 fred__w: jc  i use 3 charts for context  1yr-mo 3mo-wk 14da-da
15:47 fred__w: and look for >11ema
15:47 JC_chart: im happy with a 10 tick move on cl or gc moer is great but i am greatful for that
15:47 JC_chart: im not an ema fan
15:47 fred__w: jc  i do that to build probability
15:48 JC_chart: but i get why you use it so please dont misunderstand my intent
15:48 fred__w: jc  the particular method is not criotical  i was giving you a variation of bt's stmt
15:49 blondetrader: :)

06:18 Bealzybub: Yo-Ga
06:43 Tom: When I was on Prophet Charts last Thursday, Oct.11 the days CHARTS showed up well.  On Fri. Oct.12 (as has been the case 1-2 times per month) the chart for Thurs. was simply not there.  This has become an all too frequent occurance in 2017 &2018. Now, for the first time, the last 2 trading days are NOT showine up on Prophet Charts.  Many times I have contacted Technical Support.  I have asked them if it is "my computer or your" responsibility and have been told they "are aware of the problem."  Now, for the first time, the last 2 trading days are NOT showine up on Prophet Charts.  What is every one else out there doing about this problem?  I suspect this problem started to occur when TD Ameritrade took over.  In my communication with support personel I have been told there are other 'changes' coming.  Good Grief...Does anyone in the community have a solution...other than going to ScottTrade?
06:50 Bealzybub: Wish I could help. I cant even get answers about the "Marketwatch" trade trending lines.
06:51 Bealzybub: Which is really no problem. I'll get it figured out one way or the other. I'm making my 4% per day.
06:51 Tom: Do you have the same problem on Prophet Charts?
06:52 Bealzybub: I dont even know what that is. Which is the same answer I get when asking about "Marketwatch".
06:53 Bealzybub: I mean I've just been asking the community here and havent bothered tech @ Ameritrade.
07:00 Tom: TDAmer took over ThinkOrSwim, which as their trading platform, has the wonderful old Investools platform (if I have the history correct), but the Tech Support people have not been able to solve this problem.  They admit it is their issue and not my computer.  When the went over to Ameritrade we lost many of the research abilities and one, in particular, indicator...Virtual Volume (VV%).  All of the placating and "education support" they've offered have been ineffective in helping together with direct conversation.  I've moved funds and not placed funds with them because of their lack of genuine support.  This is the first time I've gone public and have asked for anyone with solutions to the problem and any similar experience(s).  
07:02 Tom: Is anyone else out there using the ThinkOrSwim, Prophet Charts platform for trading, research, etc?
07:06 Tom: It is still early in the morning to get suffiecient responses, but as I've turned on the ThinkOrSwim website & platform, I've noticed that the past 2 trading days (last Thurs. & Friday) charts are simply not there, even though I used them on their given days!
07:39 nora: Hi Tom.   TDam had announced last year that they were not going to support/upgrade Prophet charts any more.  In fact it was supposed to go away.  I have used and still am trying to use Prophet charts but recognze its limitation.  I am surprised that it is still functioning and available.  The Tos charts have lots of problems amd limitations also.
07:40 nora: My prophet charts have thurs and Friday.
07:40 MTS1: Tom; TDA 'took over' Thinkorswim ages ago, as well as prophet charts and more recently invest tools. ScottTrade was the most recent addition that they took over, but did not intergrate their platform. Prophetcharts has been slated for retirement for a while also, when supposedly all features are moved to TOS, but still left in for legacy users complaining when it was removed. I would not continue relying on prophet as a primary platform considering the priorities within TDA / TOS, and see if the TOS side is a better fit.
07:41 Nube: Prophet charts are no longer supported with any particular concern so I wouldn't expect to continue to work with them
07:41 MTS1: So you're too late to move to ScottTr;)
07:44 nora: The TOS charting had a really tough time last Wed and Thurs because of the high volume.  The charts froze for different lengths of time and lagged fro others.   
07:44 dellsystem: Whats going on with WTW  no Last 
07:50 nora: i have a premarket last... for WTW, 66.88 fwiw
07:51 dellsystem: Yes the  Feed is not updating  Think or Swim
08:01 dellsystem: Just updated
08:01 dellsystem: and now retracted
08:02 Tom: Where are the rest of you with your charts & research?  Where are the great trading platforms today?
08:03 AlphaInvestor: #TOSisBoss
08:04 Tom: Sorry Alpha...but read my paragraphs, above.  I used to think the same as you!
08:05 AlphaInvestor: Prophet is being sunsetted, suck it up and use TOS charts
08:05 AlphaInvestor: I can no longer get parts for my Edsel either
08:06 Tom: My complaints are about TOS...I HAVE TOS, and Prophet charts are what is displayed!
08:06 radon224: Alpha, I can give you a link for Edsel parts if you need it
08:06 AlphaInvestor: Prophet Charts = bye bye
08:06 Tom: How do I make the switch you describe?
08:07 Tom: I've been with InvestTools, TOS since 2007 but have received no notices for any type of switch that I can recall.
08:08 AlphaInvestor: There are two charting systems right now in thinkorswim a) TOS charts, b) Prophet Charts. Learn to use A, because B is going away
08:10 tmoney20g: will do big daddy Al
08:10 gerardom: sup tmoney
08:10 tmoney20g: o hi gerar
08:10 AlphaInvestor: As MTS1 mentioned, we were told that all Prophet functionality would be moved to TOS charts before it finally goes away
08:10 gerardom: gm man
08:10 tmoney20g: missed you on friday
08:10 tmoney20g: got my trailstop for options working
08:11 tmoney20g: just have to get used to it
08:11 tmoney20g: don't know why i didn't enable that 6 months ago
08:11 gerardom: nice! im going to test once out today
08:12 saint: where do i find level  2
08:12 gerardom: did u get into any positions from friday?
08:12 AlphaInvestor: Tmoney - as I mentioned last week, if you are using Stops with options... Then you don't understand options!!!
08:12 Tom: Alright...show me how to get to TOS charts. TOS is now what I use...but the chart display is still called/labeled "Prophet."  How do I enable it?  Tech Support has NOT suggested that in any of my communications with them.
08:13 Tom: When you converted were there any deletions of your current information, at the time?
08:13 tmoney20g: went 4/4 on friday
08:13 AlphaInvestor: TOS charts are to the left of Prophet Charts on the menu
08:14 Tom: I'll start there, Alpha.
08:15 radon224: RIP SHLD....no surprise
08:15 tmoney20g: never even heard of "prophet" charts
08:20 AlphaInvestor: Don't get me wrong, I love Prophet Charts
08:21 Nube: Tom, click the charts tab. Those aren't he ToS charts. Click the Prophet tab and you get the Prophet charts.
08:21 Vimes: I should maybe give them a second look, just confusing that they have two charting engines on the same platform
08:22 AlphaInvestor: That's why one is going away
08:22 tmoney20g: if they are going away, why even bother
08:22 tmoney20g: looking like buyers at the open ?
08:23 Nube: Prophet had the advantage of being able to do ratio charts in the ticket box and it had a better pattern finder but those are the only two advantages I ever found it to have. Had more historic data which could be meaningful depending on the user but ToS has mucho historic data now too
08:23 tmoney20g: what's your take on the econ data Al ?
08:24 AlphaInvestor: Pattern Finder in Prophet is da bee's knees
08:26 Scott_OT: Only 1 out of three computers I have TOS on shows a prophet tab.
08:27 tmoney20g: 2 minutes
08:27 AlphaInvestor: Tmoney - must have sold lotsa cars to get the combination of numbers released this morning
08:28 esmal: good morning all
08:28 tmoney20g: i was interested in the internet retail
08:28 tmoney20g: up 1.1% i think they said
08:28 tmoney20g: but amazon gapped down a little at 830
08:29 tmoney20g: what you eyeing esmal ?
08:29 Nube: My take on econ data is that we should outlaw collecting it so there charlatans of monetary experiment can't use it as an excuse to monkey around
08:29 AlphaInvestor: Internet retailing... It's just a fad
08:30 esmal: no clue lol
08:30 Nube: Amazon has had an epic couple of decades, it is allowed a small gap down
08:32 Tom: Thanks Nube, Nube & Alpha: The Vrtual Volume (VV%) in Prophet Charts was a wonderful tool for determining volume of the day vs volume of the past 90+ days...one look and you knew!  Anything like that on TOS, Alpha?
08:33 AlphaInvestor: Custom scripts exist to do virtual volume
08:33 Tom: Thanks, Vimes, as well!
08:35 radon224: Some goofball is calling for $400/bbl oil if the US sanctions Saudi Arabia.
08:42 AlphaInvestor: Bring it on - my portfolio is well positioned for that
08:44 fred__w: just went short
08:45 fred__w: lets ee what happens
08:46 AlphaInvestor: Some more bathwater being thrown out ... babies included
08:49 Eedie: Ok es bounced a little off the 200
08:50 Eedie: Let’s see if it can get some mojo

08:59 blondetrader: marcos
08:59 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: fred, sounds like u did research too. nasdaq did same action in 2000.  undercut 200 and then bounced, retrace 50% of losses over 3 months before dropping again.  but that was start of major bear.
08:59 mep1976: hey bt

08:59 esmal: then i switched to puts and came up
09:00 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: check out thos 5m candles on gdx

09:01 tmoney20g: i'm switched, but not in yet
09:02 esmal: @darryl how you feeling on gdx? looks like its sideways at to me
09:03 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: dip, buy, dip, buy, dip, buy, dip, buy.......
09:03 blondetrader: es tgts lower -50 30 and 2698
09:05 fred__w: all in south  now
09:06 JT the Musician: feel like I should have shorted CRMD
09:06 esmal: so NFLX cancelled Iron Fist
09:08 Vimes: boo
09:09 Vimes: actually it was pretty bad
09:09 radon224: so we are below the 200DMA on SPX, by about 13 points
