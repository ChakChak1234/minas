15:23 VolCrush: so bronx, don't u owe us something?
15:23 RandomDan: I think the market is set to go sideways, newsflow dependent.
15:24 blondetrader: lol
15:24 blondetrader: we didnt open 2780 so I only owe it to u
15:25 AlphaInvestor: So, WFC which missed E is up 1.3% today ... but JPM that beat E is down 1.09% today. What kinda bizarro world do we live in.
15:26 VolCrush: ok, i'll wait patiently for the "ping" on my phone

any second now, right?
15:26 blondetrader: keep watching for it
15:26 JC_chart: cuirious on rty trade
15:26 RandomDan: It's my fault Al. Fins going up as soon as I take a loss on my GS.
15:26 JC_chart: mind sharing your entry and exit and chart timeframe
15:26 RandomDan: but I don't feel like doing that
15:26 VolCrush: welp you Alpha, more than anyone here know that funnies don't mean chit with respect to how the market reacts
ergo, drop funnies
LOL
15:27 JC_chart: totally ok if you say no... just interested

15:28 blondetrader: JC I am flat rn
15:28 blondetrader: this was not the day I expected
15:28 blondetrader: haha no
15:28 JC_chart: did you hold it thru last night?
15:28 blondetrader: I did
15:28 blondetrader: and got stopped out this am
15:28 JC_chart: holy s**
15:28 JC_chart: that's a big stop LOL
15:29 blondetrader: no lol I made $$
15:29 RandomDan: bt, really. This is exactly the day I expected... using your TA!
15:29 JC_chart: i am sure you did
15:29 JC_chart: u were short right
15:29 AlphaInvestor: Vol - with both reporting the same day, they should have reacted in relation to their E results
15:29 blondetrader: :)
15:29 JC_chart: as of yesterday afternoon
15:29 blondetrader: no i was long into this am
15:29 VolCrush: welp send me a pic wearing red soled only then...........
15:29 JC_chart: ohhh i thought you were short
15:29 VolCrush: Alpha, they did
15:29 JC_chart: it went up 25 points
15:29 blondetrader: nooo I was on for the rally pffft
15:29 blondetrader: I was looking for 95 lol
15:30 RandomDan: she was long, I remember
15:30 JC_chart: what tiemframe do you use to identify entries
15:30 blondetrader: 4 hr mostly
15:30 blondetrader: and dly
15:30 RandomDan: so what about the day didn't go as you expected?
15:30 blondetrader: well Dan I thought the pop would have more teeth
15:30 blondetrader: this was like a little kitten
15:30 blondetrader: not a lion
15:31 RandomDan: I thought it was pretty good, considering the wreckage.
15:31 blondetrader: I would not be surprised to see another wave of selling monday am b4 we get any consecutive days of green
15:31 blondetrader: dissapointing
15:32 blondetrader: but i have some scary tgts lower
15:32 RandomDan: the day was a big cup, also a positive.
15:32 blondetrader: so to avoid mkt need to do some work
15:32 VolCrush: not a bad pop actually, only because the close was vary gud on /nq
so respectfully disagree
15:32 blondetrader: nq could rally another 100
15:32 blondetrader: and still look like shit
15:32 VolCrush: or more
15:33 blondetrader: btw that would be res for leg 2
15:33 blondetrader: anything over........we good
15:33 VolCrush: well we wanna buy chit, who wants to buy gud?
15:33 blondetrader: lol yes but if nq fails that
15:33 blondetrader: you can buy it a lot cheaper
15:33 VolCrush: sell against
15:34 blondetrader: like to the tune of67s
15:34 VolCrush: true but we got pick our lines in der sand
15:34 blondetrader: figure 150 off this weeks low would be next tgt dn
15:34 blondetrader: well nq needs to hold 7112
15:34 VolCrush: i gots my names for hunting season and will fall on my sword if necessary
15:34 JC_chart: we could have some violent upswing no doubt in the indexes but I think insitutions need market to drop more so they can buy it and bid it back up like they do in every cycle
15:35 blondetrader: yes
15:35 AlphaInvestor: I think this past couple days was selling der MoMo and a rotation into Quality. MSFT, ADBE and such did very well for me when those trades were put in this week during the downturn
15:35 blondetrader: as i mentioned we have a htf bear move happening that isnt complete momo wise
15:35 blondetrader: and we have a dly oversold
15:35 VolCrush: heck i wanted 6845 on /nq, when i called 7 k /nq i got laffed out of here 
15:35 blondetrader: so would make sense to get some relif
15:35 JC_chart: yeah 6800 is the midpoint for nq for a 1Y daily chart
15:36 VolCrush: ah hah, ty @JC
15:36 JC_chart: honestly all that matters is AMZN
15:37 JC_chart: so we should just trade that as it makes up what percent of NQ ... 60 haha
15:37 VolCrush: emmmm, der fruit is a playa and mr softie is now relevant for some reason
15:37 blondetrader: 1835 needs to break amzn
15:37 blondetrader: orr 1621 lol
15:38 blondetrader: rty closed red today
15:38 blondetrader: no bueno
15:38 VolCrush: either way lots of resistance with every pop now
15:38 JC_chart: RTY is very sick on my chart
15:38 VolCrush: yah true dat, rty is a big problem atm
15:39 blondetrader: honesly
15:39 VolCrush: yes dear
15:39 blondetrader: if it has to rinse like to get it done this month
15:39 JC_chart: it trendline has been down since 9/24 and the pitch of that line is steep not much releif soon unless earning are rocking
15:39 blondetrader: like before last week of oct
15:39 VolCrush: welp u wanna see a down trend line go see XLF
15:40 blondetrader: it made a lower low today lol
15:40 JC_chart: youre right it is sicker
15:40 blondetrader: and it leads imo
15:40 blondetrader: this turned 1-2 weeks b4 the others gave it up
15:41 JC_chart: so any of you ever traded wheat futures or soybeans?
15:41 blondetrader: yep
15:42 JC_chart: you know they have nive moves in the morning
15:42 blondetrader: I do :)
15:42 Bid_Ask: what's nive
15:42 JC_chart: and they are super volatile but i was thinking i almost like them better than es
15:42 blondetrader: for sun night mon am i am really leaning on selling rty
15:42 JC_chart: you have the same payout
15:42 blondetrader: they offer minis
15:43 blondetrader: imo the trend is more true in ags
15:43 JC_chart: i was sitting in soybeans yesterday and forgot about the monthlyr eport and it ripped about 5 dollars in a nano second
15:43 blondetrader: yea got to mind those report
15:44 JC_chart: i was lucky i was long it also whipped back so i did fine but yes that was my thought exactly when i  sold the contracts LOL
15:44 blondetrader: lol
15:45 JC_chart: when you speak of trend you are speaking of trend on daily right?
15:45 blondetrader: genericly yes
15:45 blondetrader: but I prefer when all time frames are in agreement
15:46 JC_chart: me too ibut i try to just focus on one chart
15:46 JC_chart: i look at the daily 30m for trend
15:46 JC_chart: and then trade the 3 or 1m
15:46 blondetrader: oh yea thats too small for me
15:46 JC_chart: i built some indicaotrs that are multitimeframe so that helps just using one chart
15:46 fred__w: jc  i use 3 charts for context  1yr-mo 3mo-wk 14da-da
15:47 fred__w: and look for >11ema
15:47 JC_chart: im happy with a 10 tick move on cl or gc moer is great but i am greatful for that
15:47 JC_chart: im not an ema fan
15:47 fred__w: jc  i do that to build probability
15:48 JC_chart: but i get why you use it so please dont misunderstand my intent
15:48 fred__w: jc  the particular method is not criotical  i was giving you a variation of bt's stmt
15:49 blondetrader: :)

06:18 Bealzybub: Yo-Ga
06:43 Tom: When I was on Prophet Charts last Thursday, Oct.11 the days CHARTS showed up well.  On Fri. Oct.12 (as has been the case 1-2 times per month) the chart for Thurs. was simply not there.  This has become an all too frequent occurance in 2017 &2018. Now, for the first time, the last 2 trading days are NOT showine up on Prophet Charts.  Many times I have contacted Technical Support.  I have asked them if it is "my computer or your" responsibility and have been told they "are aware of the problem."  Now, for the first time, the last 2 trading days are NOT showine up on Prophet Charts.  What is every one else out there doing about this problem?  I suspect this problem started to occur when TD Ameritrade took over.  In my communication with support personel I have been told there are other 'changes' coming.  Good Grief...Does anyone in the community have a solution...other than going to ScottTrade?
06:50 Bealzybub: Wish I could help. I cant even get answers about the "Marketwatch" trade trending lines.
06:51 Bealzybub: Which is really no problem. I'll get it figured out one way or the other. I'm making my 4% per day.
06:51 Tom: Do you have the same problem on Prophet Charts?
06:52 Bealzybub: I dont even know what that is. Which is the same answer I get when asking about "Marketwatch".
06:53 Bealzybub: I mean I've just been asking the community here and havent bothered tech @ Ameritrade.
07:00 Tom: TDAmer took over ThinkOrSwim, which as their trading platform, has the wonderful old Investools platform (if I have the history correct), but the Tech Support people have not been able to solve this problem.  They admit it is their issue and not my computer.  When the went over to Ameritrade we lost many of the research abilities and one, in particular, indicator...Virtual Volume (VV%).  All of the placating and "education support" they've offered have been ineffective in helping together with direct conversation.  I've moved funds and not placed funds with them because of their lack of genuine support.  This is the first time I've gone public and have asked for anyone with solutions to the problem and any similar experience(s).  
07:02 Tom: Is anyone else out there using the ThinkOrSwim, Prophet Charts platform for trading, research, etc?
07:06 Tom: It is still early in the morning to get suffiecient responses, but as I've turned on the ThinkOrSwim website & platform, I've noticed that the past 2 trading days (last Thurs. & Friday) charts are simply not there, even though I used them on their given days!
07:39 nora: Hi Tom.   TDam had announced last year that they were not going to support/upgrade Prophet charts any more.  In fact it was supposed to go away.  I have used and still am trying to use Prophet charts but recognze its limitation.  I am surprised that it is still functioning and available.  The Tos charts have lots of problems amd limitations also.
07:40 nora: My prophet charts have thurs and Friday.
07:40 MTS1: Tom; TDA 'took over' Thinkorswim ages ago, as well as prophet charts and more recently invest tools. ScottTrade was the most recent addition that they took over, but did not intergrate their platform. Prophetcharts has been slated for retirement for a while also, when supposedly all features are moved to TOS, but still left in for legacy users complaining when it was removed. I would not continue relying on prophet as a primary platform considering the priorities within TDA / TOS, and see if the TOS side is a better fit.
07:41 Nube: Prophet charts are no longer supported with any particular concern so I wouldn't expect to continue to work with them
07:41 MTS1: So you're too late to move to ScottTr;)
07:44 nora: The TOS charting had a really tough time last Wed and Thurs because of the high volume.  The charts froze for different lengths of time and lagged fro others.   
07:44 dellsystem: Whats going on with WTW  no Last 
07:50 nora: i have a premarket last... for WTW, 66.88 fwiw
07:51 dellsystem: Yes the  Feed is not updating  Think or Swim
08:01 dellsystem: Just updated
08:01 dellsystem: and now retracted
08:02 Tom: Where are the rest of you with your charts & research?  Where are the great trading platforms today?
08:03 AlphaInvestor: #TOSisBoss
08:04 Tom: Sorry Alpha...but read my paragraphs, above.  I used to think the same as you!
08:05 AlphaInvestor: Prophet is being sunsetted, suck it up and use TOS charts
08:05 AlphaInvestor: I can no longer get parts for my Edsel either
08:06 Tom: My complaints are about TOS...I HAVE TOS, and Prophet charts are what is displayed!
08:06 radon224: Alpha, I can give you a link for Edsel parts if you need it
08:06 AlphaInvestor: Prophet Charts = bye bye
08:06 Tom: How do I make the switch you describe?
08:07 Tom: I've been with InvestTools, TOS since 2007 but have received no notices for any type of switch that I can recall.
08:08 AlphaInvestor: There are two charting systems right now in thinkorswim a) TOS charts, b) Prophet Charts. Learn to use A, because B is going away
08:10 tmoney20g: will do big daddy Al
08:10 gerardom: sup tmoney
08:10 tmoney20g: o hi gerar
08:10 AlphaInvestor: As MTS1 mentioned, we were told that all Prophet functionality would be moved to TOS charts before it finally goes away
08:10 gerardom: gm man
08:10 tmoney20g: missed you on friday
08:10 tmoney20g: got my trailstop for options working
08:11 tmoney20g: just have to get used to it
08:11 tmoney20g: don't know why i didn't enable that 6 months ago
08:11 gerardom: nice! im going to test once out today
08:12 saint: where do i find level  2
08:12 gerardom: did u get into any positions from friday?
08:12 AlphaInvestor: Tmoney - as I mentioned last week, if you are using Stops with options... Then you don't understand options!!!
08:12 Tom: Alright...show me how to get to TOS charts. TOS is now what I use...but the chart display is still called/labeled "Prophet."  How do I enable it?  Tech Support has NOT suggested that in any of my communications with them.
08:13 Tom: When you converted were there any deletions of your current information, at the time?
08:13 tmoney20g: went 4/4 on friday
08:13 AlphaInvestor: TOS charts are to the left of Prophet Charts on the menu
08:14 Tom: I'll start there, Alpha.
08:15 radon224: RIP SHLD....no surprise
08:15 tmoney20g: never even heard of "prophet" charts
08:20 AlphaInvestor: Don't get me wrong, I love Prophet Charts
08:21 Nube: Tom, click the charts tab. Those aren't he ToS charts. Click the Prophet tab and you get the Prophet charts.
08:21 Vimes: I should maybe give them a second look, just confusing that they have two charting engines on the same platform
08:22 AlphaInvestor: That's why one is going away
08:22 tmoney20g: if they are going away, why even bother
08:22 tmoney20g: looking like buyers at the open ?
08:23 Nube: Prophet had the advantage of being able to do ratio charts in the ticket box and it had a better pattern finder but those are the only two advantages I ever found it to have. Had more historic data which could be meaningful depending on the user but ToS has mucho historic data now too
08:23 tmoney20g: what's your take on the econ data Al ?
08:24 AlphaInvestor: Pattern Finder in Prophet is da bee's knees
08:26 Scott_OT: Only 1 out of three computers I have TOS on shows a prophet tab.
08:27 tmoney20g: 2 minutes
08:27 AlphaInvestor: Tmoney - must have sold lotsa cars to get the combination of numbers released this morning
08:28 esmal: good morning all
08:28 tmoney20g: i was interested in the internet retail
08:28 tmoney20g: up 1.1% i think they said
08:28 tmoney20g: but amazon gapped down a little at 830
08:29 tmoney20g: what you eyeing esmal ?
08:29 Nube: My take on econ data is that we should outlaw collecting it so there charlatans of monetary experiment can't use it as an excuse to monkey around
08:29 AlphaInvestor: Internet retailing... It's just a fad
08:30 esmal: no clue lol
08:30 Nube: Amazon has had an epic couple of decades, it is allowed a small gap down
08:32 Tom: Thanks Nube, Nube & Alpha: The Vrtual Volume (VV%) in Prophet Charts was a wonderful tool for determining volume of the day vs volume of the past 90+ days...one look and you knew!  Anything like that on TOS, Alpha?
08:33 AlphaInvestor: Custom scripts exist to do virtual volume
08:33 Tom: Thanks, Vimes, as well!
08:35 radon224: Some goofball is calling for $400/bbl oil if the US sanctions Saudi Arabia.
08:42 AlphaInvestor: Bring it on - my portfolio is well positioned for that
08:44 fred__w: just went short
08:45 fred__w: lets ee what happens
08:46 AlphaInvestor: Some more bathwater being thrown out ... babies included
08:49 Eedie: Ok es bounced a little off the 200

08:59 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: fred, sounds like u did research too. nasdaq did same action in 2000.  undercut 200 and then bounced, retrace 50% of losses over 3 months before dropping again.  but that was start of major bear.
08:59 mep1976: hey bt

08:59 esmal: then i switched to puts and came up
09:00 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: check out thos 5m candles on gdx

09:03 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: dip, buy, dip, buy, dip, buy, dip, buy.......
09:03 blondetrader: es tgts lower -50 30 and 2698
09:05 fred__w: all in south  now
09:06 JT the Musician: feel like I should have shorted CRMD
09:06 esmal: so NFLX cancelled Iron Fist
09:08 Vimes: boo
09:09 Vimes: actually it was pretty bad
09:09 radon224: so we are below the 200DMA on SPX, by about 13 points
09:10 tanker: gm

09:23 Millionaire51: exel
09:24 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: AAPL threatening to break 50 day again.
09:24 invertedhammer: Ty bt 1531 rty
09:25 Millionaire51: Does anyone know about exel
09:25 blondetrader: :) its likely to retest
09:26 Millionaire51: Stick with Apple
09:26 blondetrader: and rty if that doesnt lod we r looking at a break of 1500 to 1485ish
09:26 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: there's the computer buy orders on AAPL
09:28 invertedhammer: Ty
09:28 Millionaire51: Uncle just bought 5k shares of apple . Said he will by more by noon
09:30 invertedhammer: Short 44
09:31 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: we'll see what happens.  if it breaks the 50 day again, market might roll over too.  but so far looking good.
09:32 esmal: Can you change the default order type to be a sequential, 1st trgs seq
09:34 gdr: hello traders, we are in the midst of our market correction
09:34 blondetrader: gm gdr
09:35 gdr: hi bt
09:36 blondetrader: :)
09:37 gdr: are we still buying dips?
09:37 blondetrader: I am waiting to see some targets
09:39 gdr: ok to ask whhich ones?
09:40 blondetrader: well es 2690s short term
09:40 blondetrader: as long as under 76
09:40 blondetrader: near term
09:41 gdr: new lows
09:41 blondetrader: ya 
09:42 blondetrader: but that said on way down if 2730 was to hold.....that new low may not come till AFTER a nice multi day rally
09:42 gerardom: red red and more red
09:42 gdr: imho new lows would be bearish
09:42 blondetrader: regardless we r mid cycle ehre
09:43 gdr: but still way above a bear mkt
09:43 blondetrader: well GDR at first glance I would agree but if you look at the yearly chart.....a new low would take us into a mid point that could be concidered bullish
09:43 blondetrader: exactly
09:43 blondetrader: it would be great if the low coincided with a bullish news event :)
09:45 blondetrader: based on 4 hr rty looks like overall last week low will break
09:45 gerardom: here comes another 2 or so days of red i feel
09:46 AlphaInvestor: I have an order "stuck" in cancel/eplace stautus - so I cannot add new orders that share those strikes. Anybody else experience this, and have a solutiont/workaround?
09:46 gdr: i like your chart view but the only good news imho would be ending trade wars restoring the alliance opening borders etc etc all unlikely
09:47 gdr: it happened lots before electronic trading
09:47 gdr: alpha are you in a fast market?
09:47 chenmann: i just wanna say i have no idea where markets r gonna go.....
09:47 chenmann: nice gdr...fast amret
09:48 chenmann: market
09:48 chenmann: just follow em....crooks
09:48 gdr: im on mobile too chen
09:48 chenmann: lol
09:48 Vimes: they are going to go up,if you wait long enough
09:49 chenmann: fast market = getting killed
09:49 gdr: us equities have always recovered Vimes, its just time to recovery which varies
09:50 Vimes: "long enough"
09:50 gdr: chen what happened to the long view? paint the fence wash the car
09:52 Vimes: EHC, strong today
09:52 chenmann: saw them setting it up 2 weeks ago, wish shorted more and held, this wave was much more and faster the before.....
09:52 chenmann: ....and right into er run.....crooks
09:53 radon224: wtf was that?
09:53 mthfr_vaxxed: someone posted large image that admin probably removed
09:53 fred__w: chen  me too  but i went short  no hedge  this am
09:53 lilFish: Its funny will try to post smaller
09:55 Vimes: ALSN, holding well

10:10 mep1976: @al - long term play on opioid crisis
10:10 RandomDan: pre-er speculation should make it move enough.
10:10 RandomDan: my target is $338
10:11 RandomDan: but if I see weakness I can let it go sooner

10:17 Annie: So can I sell now?
10:17 tmoney20g: will it be a good trade if you did ?
10:17 AlphaInvestor: that is irrelevant
10:18 AlphaInvestor: the question is whether today's price is a good price, regardless of what yoiu paid some day in that past .... Anchoring Bias   and    Loss Aversion Bias
10:20 Annie: ok got it. thanks

10:28 Vimes: i'm not sure what you are asking katherine, so not sure
10:28 AlphaInvestor: katherine - dig up your paper statements?
10:28 gdr: Vimes reread ai's first post, gain/ loss is irrelevant to any current/future trading decision, only future outlook matters
10:28 katherine1234: i dont have
10:28 Vimes: yeah,yeah, i just didn't see all the posts
10:28 AlphaInvestor: Gdr/Vimes - but we all do it, I want all my trades to be green before I close them - I am human after all

10:36 Scott_OT: shes prolly gone after her last post
10:36 AlphaInvestor: Scott - her loss, there are some in here that know more than the TOS support staff
10:37 AlphaInvestor: ever more knowledge in the thinkScript chat room
10:37 AlphaInvestor: Some of the TOS support staff are fantastic tho
10:37 radon224: lol, nice recovery AI
10:37 Scott_OT: nice recover
10:38 YClan: Hi,     what are you guys doing in here today?
10:39 tmoney20g: stuffs ?
10:40 AlphaInvestor: Radon - not all the support staff have been using the platform as long as some of the folks in here. It makes logical sense.
10:40 YClan: That is nice.
10:40 YClan: :39 News Bot: Atlanta Fed GDPNow (Q3) 4.0% (Prev. 4.2%)
 
10:42 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I wonder how much AAPL pays cnbc to hype their company on regular basis.
10:42 AlphaInvestor: Yclan - I think TnT has been working with the Atlanta FED to fix their random number generator
10:43 YClan: Darryl,    the game is rigged
10:43 chenmann: +
10:44 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I am glued to AAPL action, if it drops, whole market drops.  If it holds, market holds.
10:45 radon224: It could be the other way around.  Correlation is different than Causation.
10:46 AlphaInvestor: If it is rigged, find out how that it is rigged ... and use that to your advantage
10:46 chenmann: ++
10:46 gerardom: i hope apple can manage, i bought some. feeling some regret atm
10:47 YClan: ger,   all you need is WarBuf to come in a buy, and you are good.
10:47 anonp: TOS OnDemand charts seems to be broken, not moving while clock is running
10:47 gerardom: YC call him to buy haha
10:47 gerardom: you guys staying on your toes today, wild market
10:48 YClan: He should sell AAPL and buy SHLD and JCP.
10:49 gerardom: whiles hes at some amzn
10:49 YClan: Ger,   I bought CRON and am riding that into the sunset today.
10:50 gerardom: hows that treating you
10:50 gerardom: nice %?
10:51 YClan: Ger,  well.. the CRON chart is trending up..     AAPL is sideways to down.
10:51 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: AAPL 50 day exponential at 217.11
10:52 mep1976: snap putting couple good days
10:53 tmoney20g: yay Yclan is here
10:53 TheOnceAndFuture: what is going on with spy.. .sheesh
10:53 YClan: tmo,    but I got no game
10:54 YClan: Future,    just follow VIX.... 21 handle
10:54 gerardom: vix needs to tank already
10:55 TheOnceAndFuture: 
"21 handle"?
10:55 RandomDan: rug pullers giving it a go but don't seem to have the firepower
10:55 YClan: means   21.xx
10:55 TheOnceAndFuture: gotcha
10:57 RandomDan: I never understood the "handle" expression, just seems weird
10:57 YClan: Tesla Inc.  has filed to trademark "Teslaquila," which was part of several  April Fools' Day  jokes tweeted by Chief Executive  Elon Musk .    (Looks like Muskrat is focusing on the important things)
10:59 VolCrush: Muskrat?  did someone request some Captain and Tenille?
10:59 lilFish: oh lawdy
11:00 lilFish: gm vol - how was your weekend?
11:01 VolCrush: vary nice ty, how was yours
11:02 lilFish: great
11:02 lilFish: was hoping for that bounce today tho
11:10 tmoney20g: esmal, no winners today for me
11:17 jayintl: which chat room is for swing traders?
11:20 lilFish: lots of em here jay
11:22 jayintl: thx Fish
11:22 tanker: cannabis  hot today,,,,CRON up .90   CGC up  5.08
11:23 esmal: damn sorry to hear :( losses werent too bad were they?
11:23 RandomDan: carpeting people showed up
11:24 AlphaInvestor: Dan - MHK ?
11:24 RandomDan: MHK?
11:25 AlphaInvestor: Mohawk - a carpet manufacturer
11:25 RandomDan: no... just the opposite of rug pullerd
11:25 RandomDan: pullers
11:25 RandomDan: Mohawk trade?
11:26 RandomDan: jesus MHK has lost 120 points ytd
11:27 RandomDan: practically at a three year low
11:27 AlphaInvestor: signs that the housing industry isn't as hot as some make it out to be
11:28 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: another complete long green would be nice on Qs,  5m
11:28 RandomDan: yeah, well the homebuilders show you that more directly. I would think most carpeting is commercial.
11:30 tmoney20g: esmal, nah, just no winners
11:30 gerardom: no good entrys
11:30 gerardom: f me
11:31 RandomDan: carpeting also needs regular replacement. I am surprised MHK is sp sensitive.
11:31 RandomDan: so
11:31 tmoney20g: i'll wait till tomorrow
11:31 RandomDan: I would have expected it to be more of a cash cow.
11:36 RandomDan: 
11:36 AlphaInvestor: it does throw free cash, but the Levered Free Cash Flow Margin is only 1.4% (my calculation) - not a cash cow
11:36 RandomDan: too much debt?
11:37 AlphaInvestor: Debt/Equity is 0.41 which is reasonable for a manufacturer
11:38 RandomDan: new exit target for my nflx trade today is $336.
11:39 AlphaInvestor: Profit margin is 9.3%, so they must be spending too much capital
11:40 RandomDan: I'll look into the company later
11:40 RandomDan: A drop loke that gets me interested.
11:40 RandomDan: like
11:41 RandomDan: BTW over the weekebd it hit me that Bershire should get into textiles.
11:41 Vimes: umm, aren't they?
11:41 AlphaInvestor: Dan - great idea
11:42 RandomDan: I know, ain't it? I am going to write uncle Warren a letter.
11:42 Vimes: i think i missed the joke :)
11:42 AlphaInvestor: Actually Brk/A does own the other very large carpeting manufacturer - Shaw Industries
11:43 RandomDan: Vimes that was the origin of Berkshire.
11:43 AlphaInvestor: Berkshire Hathaway started as a textile mill
11:43 Vimes: as well as most vertical integrated industires
11:43 RandomDan: The joke is that Buffet considers it his worst investment.
11:44 AlphaInvestor: it was a "cigar butt" investment using Benjamin Graham's nomenclature
11:44 RandomDan: but he kept the name of the company.
11:44 RandomDan: he's got a sly sense of humorm
11:44 RandomDan: humor
11:50 mep1976: someone agrees today with me in BDSI
11:51 RandomDan: probably more than one person saw that preso
11:52 mep1976: yup
11:53 RandomDan: 335 resistance for nflx, keeps bouncing off
11:55 Vimes: I love NFLX, but man so much debt
11:56 Vimes: its one of those stocks i wished i owned but can't buy
12:04 tanker: CRON  now up 1.28   CGC up  4.85
12:05 tanker: smoke em if u got em
12:05 chenmann: beaver found wood
12:08 lilFish: anyone like a long vert in MO?
12:10 Vimes: i guess pot is the flight to safety
12:10 AlphaInvestor: I wouldn't be net long options in MO with IV Rank at 57%
12:11 lilFish: would a $62/-$63 long call vert for this week is .49?
12:11 lilFish: i see alpha
12:12 mep1976: oct 17 is vote no ? for weed in canada?
12:13 tmoney20g: don't think its a vote, just the day it becomes legal
12:13 YClan: tanker,   thanks.. I am in CRON for today
12:13 tmoney20g: thought they voted a while ago
12:13 tmoney20g: 6 months ago from 10/17
12:14 YClan: mep,    weed ls federally legal in Canada as of this coming Wed
12:14 mep1976: oh ok
12:15 mep1976: MJ  -etf looks pretty good 
12:15 radon224: Oh Canada!  Our Frozen Tundra Land!  Or somethin like that anyway.
12:16 mep1976: they should make a weed etf with the symbol THC if they haven't already lol
12:16 mep1976: or CBD
12:16 AlphaInvestor: Fish - a proper In/Out vertical would be +61.5 / -62.5 calls if yoiu can get it for about 50 cents whlie MO is at 62.00
12:16 lilFish: I"ll take a look thx
12:16 Arasmith: I am new to TD Ameritrade. I just opened an account this weekend and put $75 into that account. I have tried A few times to buy some stock, and my orders keep getting rejected. I was just wondering if it was because I do not have enough money in my account to cover commission, If I need to buy a minimum amount of stocks, if it is the stock that I am trying to buy, or if it’s something else. Please let me know.
12:17 VolCrush: BSDs seem to be havin a tuff gettin a bid in der tech space

12:18 AlphaInvestor: Vimes - worthless penny stocks fo shu
12:18 YClan: ara,   you can buy just 1 share and there is no minimum purchase.  To buy/sell 1 share or 10,000 shares should be about $7  ($14-15 round trip).
12:18 VolCrush: hmmmm, i was never rejected in high school, or college for that mattter
12:19 Vimes: because you never tried?
12:19 tmoney20g: vol, rosie always says yes

12:27 mthfr_vaxxed: where is amalia ?
12:27 Vimes: i think in seattle
12:29 YClan: amalia probably cannot see her monitor today, because we actually have sunshine in Seattle today.  That's why I'm in the dark corner of a stripper club doing my trades.

17:10 yoz: so what's all this Saudi drama going to do to oil prices?  What I've been reading is that it could skyrocket oil if it all leads to heavy tariffs on Saudi oil, so.. you guessed it, GUSH may jump back up to 40+ real quick if it turns our the Saudis killed that guy
17:14 tmoney20g: Al, what indicators do you use ?
17:14 tmoney20g: since tos has so darn many
17:15 AlphaInvestor: I use several - Bollinger Bands, ADX, LinearRegressionChannel are some of the built in ones that I use
17:16 tmoney20g: i'll take a peek at those
17:16 tmoney20g: i'm in the studies dictionary now
17:16 AlphaInvestor: I also use RSI_Laguerre, Fractal Pivots, Pivots with Projections, The ORB, the real IV_Percentile
17:17 AlphaInvestor: custom studies
17:18 AlphaInvestor: and a few of my own concoction like Internal Bar Strength, Absolute Momentum
17:21 AlphaInvestor: Tmoney - since you are getting more into Options, IMO this is the most important study for options traders. Meant to be used on 1 Year Daily chart
http://tos.mx/bO1Rr7#
17:23 AlphaInvestor: I am heading out, if you have any questions, hit me up tomorrow
17:35 tmoney20g: ok ty
17:38 yoz: haha... MedMen is featured on Cramer rn... AI.. gotta comment on this
17:47 tmoney20g: his link was weird
17:47 tmoney20g: wanted me to reinstall tos
17:47 tmoney20g: have to ask him more later
17:50 TheOnceAndFuture: Add it in TOS manually
17:52 EllyEl: is GE dead or is this a nice supply zone?!
18:03 Kobias: Wouldn't touch it before $9
18:15 RandomDan: I don't think GE gets to 9.
18:17 RandomDan: I got some at 11.24, and that was fleeting. That bottom may be tested again, but it was quite a support.
18:17 chenmannmobile: nice trade nflx today dan, did u take profit
18:17 chenmannmobile: ?
18:18 ameriman: Your TLRY is back up new swing high
18:19 ameriman: Near swing high
18:19 ameriman: GE made higher high so now more probable to make higher low and move up
18:19 chenmannmobile: they gonna push all pot stocks up before the 17th
18:21 tmoney20g: its almost like earnings
18:21 tmoney20g: except its pot legalization
18:23 RandomDan: yes chen I did. sold the same 50 @ 337.60, so a clean $500. still holding another 100 I have had for a while, (336 pp, so a bit under water now). Not sure how to play it tomorrow.
18:23 chenmannmobile: nice
18:25 RandomDan: well... we'll see. Sure the trade was nice, but if I hold the 100 and ER goes south, no joy there
18:25 chenmannmobile: u gonna gamble and hold over er?
18:26 RandomDan: I usually don't.
18:26 RandomDan: but I am torn.
18:26 chenmannmobile: yeah, not sure
18:27 chenmannmobile: but i think there s a bid under nio, someone s buying every time near 7
18:27 RandomDan: it's already been punished by tye last ER, so the bar is considerably lower
18:28 RandomDan: yes, I agree with NIO. I was able to pick some up under $7 only once.
18:28 RandomDan: about $6.80
18:29 RandomDan: it did touch lower tyan that though.
18:29 RandomDan: like $6.20 or something.
18:30 RandomDan: but didn't last very long.
18:32 RandomDan: any thoughts on NIO or NFLX chen?
18:32 chenmannmobile: like nio
18:32 amalia: Buy them.
18:32 chenmannmobile: think nflx will pop on er, but only for a day or two....
18:33 chenmannmobile: i may gamble on nflx tomorrow just for an er pop, not sure yet
18:37 tmoney20g: wouldn't have worked last quarter
18:37 tmoney20g: just be careful
18:37 RandomDan: I am still guarded on the rest of the market. NVDA weakness surprised me today.
18:37 chenmannmobile: yep
18:37 RandomDan: Chen if I get rid of my NFLX, I will let you know.
18:37 chenmannmobile: not sure what happened there....nvda
18:37 chenmannmobile: k
18:39 RandomDan: I am in the red with nvda, gs, twtr
18:39 RandomDan: I especially want to get rid of gs. It's been a complete dog
18:40 chenmannmobile: gs er tomorrow morning
18:40 RandomDan: yep
18:40 Kobias: Dan, GE got serious resistance 12.25~12.40 I just don't see it got the energy to cross it
18:41 RandomDan: Kobias, no idea.
18:41 RandomDan: It was above 13 till the market tanked.
18:41 Kobias: I'm following it for some months. Even tried to short it when it was at 12.20... S/R at those levels was too strong and I got out even more or less
18:42 RandomDan: In this environment, no idea.
18:42 chenmannmobile: true
18:42 Kobias: agreed...
18:42 RandomDan: I bought very well and have only 200 shares now, so not really worried.
18:42 RandomDan: nvda, gs, much bigger probs.
18:43 Kobias: Am still holding my Nov calls on ADBE - had nice move after hours nut I think it may be just shortcovering
18:43 Kobias: but*
18:43 RandomDan: definitely some chatter around that name now.
18:44 Kobias: plz share
18:44 Kobias: or link
18:45 RandomDan: just been seeing it a lot tgis past week or so. Nothing specific.
18:45 RandomDan: this
18:45 Kobias: I צקשמ ןכ איקרק,ד דםצקאיןמע נקטםמג איקןר עוןגשמבק
18:45 RandomDan: ?
18:45 chenmannmobile: adbe news after hours
18:45 Kobias: Meaning If you got something beyond their guidance
18:45 RandomDan: Nie wiem
18:45 Kobias: sorry about that
18:45 chenmannmobile: reaffirming guidence
18:46 RandomDan: yeah, I don't think it was short covering
18:46 Kobias: ok that's cool. I thought there's more news. Once in a while there's a rumor that MSFT is going to buy them.
18:48 Kobias: Already in 2016 I heard it first
18:48 RandomDan: that would suck
18:48 ameriman: You are a doctor?
18:48 ameriman: google translate
18:49 Kobias: lol this won't work - it's giberish -I thought I was typing in english
18:50 RandomDan: I thought you knew hebrew
18:50 Kobias: Of course I do
18:51 Kobias: But I was typing in english while the keyboard was set on hebrew font. thus giberish...
18:52 RandomDan: I see.
18:52 Kobias: our keyboards are dual language naturally.
18:54 RandomDan: I understand. I have my phone set for English, Spanish, and Polish
18:54 tmoney20g: can i play a day, like rewind today and have it start over ?
18:54 tmoney20g: in tos ?
18:54 Kobias: Well I hope you're right, and it's not short covering... I am taking pain on this position the last week.
18:54 RandomDan: on my phone
18:55 Kobias: cool
18:56 ameriman: tmoney ondemand feature
18:56 RandomDan: on my computer I have a US keyboatd but set to US-International.
18:56 tmoney20g: i see it, i'll mess with it
18:56 tmoney20g: thanks ameri
18:56 RandomDan: so you might see some weird letter from me every once in a whilę
18:57 Kobias: I got Heb, Eng - and used to have Rus too -- for my ex :)
18:57 ameriman: yw, close all charts and keep only one open for ondemand to work best, also avoid complex custom studies
19:08 tmoney20g: ameri, guess i can't replay today, until tomorrow ?
19:26 RandomDan: a lot of techs higher AH
19:30 tmoney20g: any trailing stop pros here ?
19:31 tmoney20g: wondering if, say you set a percentage trail, does it stay with the percentage when you bought it ?
19:31 tmoney20g: or say its 10%, is it always 10% of whatever the current price is
19:33 ameriman: /NQ and /ES up so tech also up
19:33 phil: hello everyone
19:33 tmoney20g: hi
19:33 ameriman: Yes 10% of current price
19:33 ameriman: But I never use trailing stop
19:34 tmoney20g: ok
19:34 phil: question..today I tried selling my shares . I put it on stop. I rejected my stop trade? why?
19:34 tmoney20g: so if you're in a call option that goes from like 2500 to 4000, its best to track it and shrink the percentage
19:35 ameriman: I just read the tape
19:35 phil: has that happened to anyone?
19:35 ameriman: I’d tape tells me to exit I exit
19:35 ameriman: If
19:35 tmoney20g: phil, if you expand the trade in the trade tab, it should say why it was rejected
19:36 phil: weird..how do I do that?
19:37 tmoney20g: you on mobile or computer
19:37 ameriman: If you had stop limit and were trading a wide bid ask spread stock and the spread jumped over your stop limit it won’t execute
19:37 ameriman: That is why I avoid wide bid ask stocks
19:38 ameriman: Usually pennies are wide
19:38 phil: the stock was at 173..I put it at 170 stop..it rejected it outright
19:38 ameriman: What is current price of stock?
19:39 phil: it never reached 170 today but it is now at 171
19:39 ameriman: The sentence cut off, it is now at what?
19:39 phil: at 171
19:40 ameriman: If it never went below 170 then why do you expect stop to have executed?
19:40 phil: when I sent out my order it said rejected...and its under cancel
19:41 ameriman: Did you send order after hours?
19:41 phil: so are you saying it remains rejected status until it hits 170
19:41 ameriman: No
19:42 phil: i sent one order before hours and one order during hours, the sane ordet
19:42 phil: the same order
19:42 ameriman: Then call support so they can look into your account to see why this happened
19:43 phil: makes no sense why its rejected..will speak to a td rep
19:43 phil: yeah I think that is what I should do..Thanks..but very bizarre
19:44 phil: thanks ameriman
19:44 ameriman: yw
19:45 ameriman: When sending order before or after hours you have to select EXT otherwise it won’t get placed
