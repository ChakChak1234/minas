10:35 AlphaInvestor: Sell-off very orderly today
10:35 YClan: ALpha,    must be the bots selling?
10:36 ronj: I like the idea of sector rotation ......is what is going on in the market.
10:36 ronj: Soooooooooo What sector is turning up?..............Gold.........I did my final buys of AUY yesterday.
10:36 Vimes: not sure what sectors are getting bought, this is a selloff
10:37 AlphaInvestor: No, not sector rotation
10:37 chenmann: cash
10:37 AlphaInvestor: Flight to Quality
10:37 tmoney20g: i like crop rotation
10:37 tmoney20g: keeps the soils nice
10:37 YClan: TNX/Bonds interest rate is down today...  seems like the techie market and FANG just got too far ahead of itself.
10:38 tmoney20g: plant corn a couple years, then tomatos
10:38 gerardom: where does all the money go when people dump?
10:38 ronj: The Russell hit what is known as a Reaction line.......last night and reversed. A stock that i am watching for a reversal in here is mxwl. I made a lot on the short side this year.
10:38 tmoney20g: to whoever buys
10:38 esmal: gear did you sell?
10:38 esmal: just getting back
10:38 YClan: Ger,    the IRS takes their share   :)
10:38 gerardom: yea i sold esmal
10:39 gerardom: im trying to get back in lol
10:39 Vimes: even defensive sectors, xlu, xlp, xle are delling off
10:39 chenmann: crooks want lock in cash before year end
10:40 YClan: Chen,  I keep watching WMT, TGT, BBY... thinking they will soon start pumping up those stocks as we begin xmas shopping hype/hope.
10:40 tmoney20g: finally getting a direction
10:40 Vimes: i'm still optimistic we will get a rally into the eoy before the s**t really hits the fan
10:40 tmoney20g: Yclan, coming into ER again too
10:40 JabbaTheCabin: geardom - it goes to shortsellers. Thank you very much.
10:40 YClan: Chen,  all under the guise of how wages are 'up', and 'full employment', therefore a 'big xmas' coming.
10:41 tmoney20g: they said 100% of the time, stocks are up a month after midterm elections
10:41 YClan: :38 News Bot: US oil firms restoring operations in Gulf of Mexico 
10:42 YClan: :38 News Bot: OPEC oil shipments will fall by 450k BPD to 25.1mln BPD in the four weeks to Oct. 27 vs. period to Sept. 29, according to data from tanker tracker Oil Movements. Mideast shipments, including Oman and Yemen, will slump by 730k BPD to 17.94m BPD
10:42 tmoney20g: micheal really ripped some stuff up down there
10:43 ronj: Watch out for Brexit to hit the head lines again.
10:43 YClan: Also, I think China said they won't buying USA oil...  so with OPEC shipping less oil... where will China get the oil it needs?   My guess is from Russia.
10:44 frank7073: canadians in pot cleared to travel to US
10:44 esmal: they need to go ahead and legalize weed
10:45 frank7073: ha 
10:45 frank7073: yea
10:46 YClan: Frank,   all that article says is if a Canaidan works in the pot industry are allowed to cross into the USA  (but not with pot).
10:47 tmoney20g: gerar, getting close
10:47 esmal: this little rally bout to be in my favor
10:47 tmoney20g: what you doin next esmal ?
10:47 tmoney20g: uh oh, having power issues here
10:47 esmal: bought to sell these 1680 calls
10:47 tmoney20g: just lost a phase for a second
10:47 gerardom: 1720 wow
10:47 esmal: set my trailstop to -0.75
10:47 tmoney20g: i'm eyeing up 2x 1650 puts
10:48 YClan: Frank, even here in Seattle where pot is legal.... you cannot take it with you to the airport, because airport is federal.  So they have 'green garbage boxes' at the airport where you can drop-off your pot so you don't get arrested at airport.
10:48 esmal: closing the gap to -0.50
10:48 gerardom: im thinking the same, puts
10:49 esmal: and im out
10:49 gerardom: overbought at 1723 lets see
10:49 tmoney20g: esmal, you have to cancel/replace each time ?
10:50 esmal: yeah, theres other ways to do it but i just cancel and replace
10:50 lilFish: fb
10:50 tmoney20g: kk
10:50 tmoney20g: thx
10:50 tmoney20g: not conviced of a buy yet gerar
10:51 vipin: looks like s&p may give a pin bar today followed by a rally
10:51 YClan: NUGT   +13% today.
10:53 tmoney20g: now we're getting there
10:56 JC_chart: just out of nvda long $239 -242
10:57 tmoney20g: gerar, 11:57 Jeremy_M: Yes, once you upgrade to Advanced features, you will see the option to do so under the Order types there. It will take care of it for you!
10:58 gerardom: u in tmoney?
10:58 tmoney20g: nah, dude came into my helpdesk thingy
10:59 tmoney20g: you ?
10:59 tmoney20g: little downtrend here, guess i missed out
10:59 gerardom: nope was waiting lol
11:00 tmoney20g: i was ready to buy 2 @ 8.00
11:00 tmoney20g: got distracted
11:00 tmoney20g: but now we know how to enable trailing stops
11:00 tmoney20g: should have mine enabled for tomorrow
11:01 JC_chart: haha i forgot it was monthly ag report and was sititng long in soy futures  and it popped big
11:02 YClan: :01 News Bot: US WSD-Soybean E/S 17/18 Oct 438Mbu (Prev. 395.0Mbu) 
11:02 gerardom: nice tmoney , green!!
11:03 tmoney20g: you in ?
11:03 YClan: But, China cut down on 95% of the soybeans they buy from us.....
11:03 ronj: If you think gold stocks are going up then you might think that investing in NUGT is a good idea ........heck if you look at a weekly chart ....you might need to put on a diaper. But if you do that be sure to take a weekly look at DUST and as you will figure out......the potential up move is not what it appears to be.
11:03 tmoney20g: lol, market alert: stocks tumble
11:03 tmoney20g: nice job there cnbc
11:04 JC_chart: the daily is better on nugt in my opinion, but if you are gonna trade that just not sure why you wouldnt trade gold futures ...
11:05 esmal: im not suggesting anything, but I wonder if this chat has enough power to pump and dump a stock...
11:05 tmoney20g: back to flat and midline signals
11:05 YClan: jc,   usually gold miners move about 3x vs the price of the metal.   But, futures are leveraged much higher, so also a higher risk.
11:06 tmoney20g: esmal, maybe a couple people in here could do that with their book, depends on the share price of whatever stock
11:06 tmoney20g: but i doubt my 5k would make a dent in anything
11:06 JC_chart: that actually is not true on the risk if you cap your loss and whatch for the right entires - cheaper to trade actually and no day trade pattern rules
11:08 YClan: I am riding DGAZ  (-3x UNG, natgas).   Bought in yesterday at abt 14.10.
11:10 tmoney20g: such flatness
11:10 tmoney20g: very calming
11:11 tmoney20g: guess i'll eat lunch and play some star wars
11:12 YClan: This weekend I have a dinner with Dave Cutler.
11:12 gerardom: still not in im waiting its lookingflat and boring
11:13 tmoney20g: same
11:13 tmoney20g: flat and boring is bad for options on a thursday 
11:13 tmoney20g: worse tomorrow
11:14 tmoney20g: unless we get cyclical and can play that
11:14 gerardom: exactly
11:14 esmal: up
11:14 AlphaInvestor: Tmoney - I can move option prices, I cannot move stock prices
11:14 tmoney20g: you can move mountains
11:16 AlphaInvestor: I can't get Comcast to repair my internet
11:16 tmoney20g: go repair it yourself
11:16 tmoney20g: plug it back in
11:19 tmoney20g: NJ may legalize pot on 10/29
11:20 tmoney20g: with 10 to 25% tax
11:20 AlphaInvestor: Ders a hurricane outside, I ain't goin' out in dat

11:30 esmal: i guess the chat dont like me no more none of my messages seem to be showing up
11:30 AlphaInvestor: jose QRVO* doing quite nicely today, as are most of the AAPL suppliers. Hon Hai, who manufactures iPhones blew away growth expectations in Sept
11:32 JC_chart: Looking at my chart NQ looks like a pull back before any up move maybe to 60 bottom of range is 7000
11:38 RandomDan: Too bad TnT didn't take a break from his self-exile, just for these few days. Would have loved his comments.
11:38 AlphaInvestor: two way markets
11:38 chenmann: doom
11:39 DrHouse: Dan, TNT comes in this room still
11:39 DrHouse: I took a screenshot of him in here
11:39 AlphaInvestor: internals weak, but strenghening - $ADSPD -164 but improving
11:39 RandomDan: yeah but he's not talking
11:40 RandomDan: not seeing doom chen
11:40 DrHouse: A lot fewer trades today
11:40 DrHouse: He is still in perimeter
11:40 chenmann: dan i was doing tnt....
11:40 JC_chart: what are u trading dr house
11:40 chenmann: no doom
11:40 chenmann: yet
11:40 YClan: 24 News Bot: China will not be named currency manipulator in Treasury's Semiannual Currency Report next week, ForexLive reports citing Politico 
11:41 chenmann: in fact ,  i may go long intc
11:42 RandomDan: that... could work. not too risky, but limited upside.
11:42 DrHouse: Majority of my trades are with AMD, AMZN, TSLA, /es, /nq, /ym
11:42 DrHouse: A lot smaller trades in between with others. But those are my big players
11:42 DrHouse: @jc
11:43 radon224: why would anyone want a screenshot of TnT in the chat room list?  Seems kinda......hmmmm.
11:43 chenmann: lol
11:43 JC_chart: day trade?
11:43 DrHouse: You’re talking to a guy with many questionable moves.
11:43 DrHouse: JC, I scalp
11:44 DrHouse: And trade the pivots I see
11:44 JC_chart: there is a killer amzn trade at open i do if my indicators change direction and they all indicators agree take the trade and it works
11:44 JC_chart: i didnt do it today as i was trading gc
11:44 AlphaInvestor: chen - I will sell you my INTC*^
11:44 DrHouse: AI, how much per share we talking
11:45 AlphaInvestor: I sell at the ask
11:45 JC_chart: yeah i wouldnt go long INTC it is moving back to its support a bit away... may ounce off that but conflict on my chart on 5m timeframe
11:45 RandomDan: many killer trades today. I missed one by a hair. Too slow.
11:45 DrHouse: I will buy all your INTC shares a dollar under the market price. All cash, and I will even let you stroke my cat.
11:46 DrHouse: Dan, today is working nicely
11:46 AlphaInvestor: Chen - INTC recently outsourced some of its 14 nm production to TSM ... that isn't done by a strong chip manufacturer. I am going longer TSM, and staying fully hedged on INTC
11:46 chenmann: k
11:47 AlphaInvestor: of course the man in the mirror must make the final decision
11:47 chenmann: i just follow the crooks....something s up there
11:47 chenmann: intc
11:47 RandomDan: we are definitely reaching the end of Moore's law with current tech.
11:48 AlphaInvestor: INTC is having trouble with its 10 nm node shrink, TSM already shrunk to 7 nm (although the nm ratings are probably equivalent or close to it)
11:49 JC_chart: LOL i worked at intel for 10 years 15 years ago and they were convinced moores law was dont then LOL
11:49 AlphaInvestor: working another MSFT pcs
11:50 RandomDan: it's not infinite, you start to have quantum effects, etc. This is why Apple has to shift to subscription and service revenue: upgrade cycles will start to stretch out.
11:51 JC_chart: im short /NQ  from 7078
11:52 JC_chart: but its turning so out  at  7058
