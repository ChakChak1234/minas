10:35 AlphaInvestor: Sell-off very orderly today
10:35 YClan: ALpha,    must be the bots selling?
10:36 ronj: I like the idea of sector rotation ......is what is going on in the market.
10:36 ronj: Soooooooooo What sector is turning up?..............Gold.........I did my final buys of AUY yesterday.
10:36 Vimes: not sure what sectors are getting bought, this is a selloff
10:37 AlphaInvestor: No, not sector rotation
10:37 chenmann: cash
10:37 AlphaInvestor: Flight to Quality
10:37 tmoney20g: i like crop rotation
10:37 tmoney20g: keeps the soils nice
10:37 YClan: TNX/Bonds interest rate is down today...  seems like the techie market and FANG just got too far ahead of itself.
10:38 tmoney20g: plant corn a couple years, then tomatos
10:38 gerardom: where does all the money go when people dump?
10:38 ronj: The Russell hit what is known as a Reaction line.......last night and reversed. A stock that i am watching for a reversal in here is mxwl. I made a lot on the short side this year.
10:38 tmoney20g: to whoever buys
10:38 esmal: gear did you sell?
10:38 esmal: just getting back
10:38 YClan: Ger,    the IRS takes their share   :)
10:38 gerardom: yea i sold esmal
10:39 gerardom: im trying to get back in lol
10:39 Vimes: even defensive sectors, xlu, xlp, xle are delling off
10:39 chenmann: crooks want lock in cash before year end
10:40 YClan: Chen,  I keep watching WMT, TGT, BBY... thinking they will soon start pumping up those stocks as we begin xmas shopping hype/hope.
10:40 tmoney20g: finally getting a direction
10:40 Vimes: i'm still optimistic we will get a rally into the eoy before the s**t really hits the fan
10:40 tmoney20g: Yclan, coming into ER again too
10:40 JabbaTheCabin: geardom - it goes to shortsellers. Thank you very much.
10:40 YClan: Chen,  all under the guise of how wages are 'up', and 'full employment', therefore a 'big xmas' coming.
10:41 tmoney20g: they said 100% of the time, stocks are up a month after midterm elections
10:41 YClan: :38 News Bot: US oil firms restoring operations in Gulf of Mexico 
10:42 YClan: :38 News Bot: OPEC oil shipments will fall by 450k BPD to 25.1mln BPD in the four weeks to Oct. 27 vs. period to Sept. 29, according to data from tanker tracker Oil Movements. Mideast shipments, including Oman and Yemen, will slump by 730k BPD to 17.94m BPD
10:42 tmoney20g: micheal really ripped some stuff up down there
10:43 ronj: Watch out for Brexit to hit the head lines again.
10:43 YClan: Also, I think China said they won't buying USA oil...  so with OPEC shipping less oil... where will China get the oil it needs?   My guess is from Russia.
10:44 frank7073: canadians in pot cleared to travel to US
10:44 esmal: they need to go ahead and legalize weed
10:45 frank7073: ha 
10:45 frank7073: yea
10:46 YClan: Frank,   all that article says is if a Canaidan works in the pot industry are allowed to cross into the USA  (but not with pot).
10:47 tmoney20g: gerar, getting close
10:47 esmal: this little rally bout to be in my favor
10:47 tmoney20g: what you doin next esmal ?

10:47 esmal: bought to sell these 1680 calls
10:47 tmoney20g: just lost a phase for a second
10:47 gerardom: 1720 wow
10:47 esmal: set my trailstop to -0.75
10:47 tmoney20g: i'm eyeing up 2x 1650 puts
10:48 YClan: Frank, even here in Seattle where pot is legal.... you cannot take it with you to the airport, because airport is federal.  So they have 'green garbage boxes' at the airport where you can drop-off your pot so you don't get arrested at airport.
10:48 esmal: closing the gap to -0.50
10:48 gerardom: im thinking the same, puts
10:49 esmal: and im out
10:49 gerardom: overbought at 1723 lets see
10:49 tmoney20g: esmal, you have to cancel/replace each time ?
10:50 esmal: yeah, theres other ways to do it but i just cancel and replace
10:50 lilFish: fb
10:50 tmoney20g: kk
10:50 tmoney20g: thx
10:50 tmoney20g: not conviced of a buy yet gerar
10:51 vipin: looks like s&p may give a pin bar today followed by a rally
10:51 YClan: NUGT   +13% today.
10:53 tmoney20g: now we're getting there
10:56 JC_chart: just out of nvda long $239 -242
10:57 tmoney20g: gerar, 11:57 Jeremy_M: Yes, once you upgrade to Advanced features, you will see the option to do so under the Order types there. It will take care of it for you!
10:58 gerardom: u in tmoney?
10:58 tmoney20g: nah, dude came into my helpdesk thingy
10:59 tmoney20g: you ?
10:59 tmoney20g: little downtrend here, guess i missed out
10:59 gerardom: nope was waiting lol
11:00 tmoney20g: i was ready to buy 2 @ 8.00
11:00 tmoney20g: got distracted
11:00 tmoney20g: but now we know how to enable trailing stops

11:01 JC_chart: haha i forgot it was monthly ag report and was sititng long in soy futures  and it popped big
11:02 YClan: :01 News Bot: US WSD-Soybean E/S 17/18 Oct 438Mbu (Prev. 395.0Mbu) 
11:02 gerardom: nice tmoney , green!!
11:03 tmoney20g: you in ?
11:03 YClan: But, China cut down on 95% of the soybeans they buy from us.....
11:03 ronj: If you think gold stocks are going up then you might think that investing in NUGT is a good idea ........heck if you look at a weekly chart ....you might need to put on a diaper. But if you do that be sure to take a weekly look at DUST and as you will figure out......the potential up move is not what it appears to be.
11:03 tmoney20g: lol, market alert: stocks tumble
11:03 tmoney20g: nice job there cnbc
11:04 JC_chart: the daily is better on nugt in my opinion, but if you are gonna trade that just not sure why you wouldnt trade gold futures ...
11:05 esmal: im not suggesting anything, but I wonder if this chat has enough power to pump and dump a stock...
11:05 tmoney20g: back to flat and midline signals
11:05 YClan: jc,   usually gold miners move about 3x vs the price of the metal.   But, futures are leveraged much higher, so also a higher risk.
11:06 tmoney20g: esmal, maybe a couple people in here could do that with their book, depends on the share price of whatever stock
11:06 tmoney20g: but i doubt my 5k would make a dent in anything
11:06 JC_chart: that actually is not true on the risk if you cap your loss and whatch for the right entires - cheaper to trade actually and no day trade pattern rules
11:08 YClan: I am riding DGAZ  (-3x UNG, natgas).   Bought in yesterday at abt 14.10.
11:10 tmoney20g: such flatness
11:10 tmoney20g: very calming
11:11 tmoney20g: guess i'll eat lunch and play some star wars
11:12 YClan: This weekend I have a dinner with Dave Cutler.
11:12 gerardom: still not in im waiting its lookingflat and boring
11:13 tmoney20g: same
11:13 tmoney20g: flat and boring is bad for options on a thursday 
11:13 tmoney20g: worse tomorrow
11:14 tmoney20g: unless we get cyclical and can play that
11:14 gerardom: exactly
11:14 esmal: up
11:14 AlphaInvestor: Tmoney - I can move option prices, I cannot move stock prices
11:14 tmoney20g: you can move mountains
11:16 AlphaInvestor: I can't get Comcast to repair my internet
11:16 tmoney20g: go repair it yourself
11:16 tmoney20g: plug it back in
11:19 tmoney20g: NJ may legalize pot on 10/29
11:20 tmoney20g: with 10 to 25% tax
11:20 AlphaInvestor: Ders a hurricane outside, I ain't goin' out in dat

11:30 esmal: i guess the chat dont like me no more none of my messages seem to be showing up
11:30 AlphaInvestor: jose QRVO* doing quite nicely today, as are most of the AAPL suppliers. Hon Hai, who manufactures iPhones blew away growth expectations in Sept
11:32 JC_chart: Looking at my chart NQ looks like a pull back before any up move maybe to 60 bottom of range is 7000
11:38 RandomDan: Too bad TnT didn't take a break from his self-exile, just for these few days. Would have loved his comments.
11:38 AlphaInvestor: two way markets
11:38 chenmann: doom
11:39 DrHouse: Dan, TNT comes in this room still
11:39 DrHouse: I took a screenshot of him in here
11:39 AlphaInvestor: internals weak, but strenghening - $ADSPD -164 but improving
11:39 RandomDan: yeah but he's not talking
11:40 RandomDan: not seeing doom chen
11:40 DrHouse: A lot fewer trades today
11:40 DrHouse: He is still in perimeter
11:40 chenmann: dan i was doing tnt....
11:40 JC_chart: what are u trading dr house
11:40 chenmann: no doom
11:40 chenmann: yet
11:40 YClan: 24 News Bot: China will not be named currency manipulator in Treasury's Semiannual Currency Report next week, ForexLive reports citing Politico 
11:41 chenmann: in fact ,  i may go long intc
11:42 RandomDan: that... could work. not too risky, but limited upside.
11:42 DrHouse: Majority of my trades are with AMD, AMZN, TSLA, /es, /nq, /ym
11:42 DrHouse: A lot smaller trades in between with others. But those are my big players
11:42 DrHouse: @jc
11:43 radon224: why would anyone want a screenshot of TnT in the chat room list?  Seems kinda......hmmmm.
11:43 chenmann: lol
11:43 JC_chart: day trade?
11:43 DrHouse: You’re talking to a guy with many questionable moves.
11:43 DrHouse: JC, I scalp
11:44 DrHouse: And trade the pivots I see
11:44 JC_chart: there is a killer amzn trade at open i do if my indicators change direction and they all indicators agree take the trade and it works
11:44 JC_chart: i didnt do it today as i was trading gc
11:44 AlphaInvestor: chen - I will sell you my INTC*^
11:44 DrHouse: AI, how much per share we talking
11:45 AlphaInvestor: I sell at the ask
11:45 JC_chart: yeah i wouldnt go long INTC it is moving back to its support a bit away... may ounce off that but conflict on my chart on 5m timeframe
11:45 RandomDan: many killer trades today. I missed one by a hair. Too slow.
11:45 DrHouse: I will buy all your INTC shares a dollar under the market price. All cash, and I will even let you stroke my cat.
11:46 DrHouse: Dan, today is working nicely
11:46 AlphaInvestor: Chen - INTC recently outsourced some of its 14 nm production to TSM ... that isn't done by a strong chip manufacturer. I am going longer TSM, and staying fully hedged on INTC
11:46 chenmann: k
11:47 AlphaInvestor: of course the man in the mirror must make the final decision
11:47 chenmann: i just follow the crooks....something s up there
11:47 chenmann: intc
11:47 RandomDan: we are definitely reaching the end of Moore's law with current tech.
11:48 AlphaInvestor: INTC is having trouble with its 10 nm node shrink, TSM already shrunk to 7 nm (although the nm ratings are probably equivalent or close to it)
11:49 JC_chart: LOL i worked at intel for 10 years 15 years ago and they were convinced moores law was dont then LOL
11:49 AlphaInvestor: working another MSFT pcs
11:50 RandomDan: it's not infinite, you start to have quantum effects, etc. This is why Apple has to shift to subscription and service revenue: upgrade cycles will start to stretch out.
11:51 JC_chart: im short /NQ  from 7078
11:52 JC_chart: but its turning so out  at  7058
11:53 AlphaInvestor: AAPL is smart - by making the battery not user replacable, they get service revenue there too
11:54 JC_chart: ohh on AMZN ... yesterday it ws $23
11:55 JC_chart: and its been trading like that for about 3 weeks 2-4 days a week and i would say it averages 4-10 dollars  and it is very reliable i
11:56 AlphaInvestor: I like the 1600/1590 pcs on AMZN - good support at 1600
11:57 chenmann: nice
11:57 chenmann: fib 61.8 amzn 1610ish
11:57 JC_chart: what timeframe
11:57 AlphaInvestor: berg/ed for fibbing
11:57 chenmann: u dont use fib al?
11:57 DrHouse: Next person to get berg’ed is going to be because they’re using MACD
11:58 AlphaInvestor: Nov 23 expiration - 3 dolla credit for a 10 dolla wide .29 delta
11:58 AlphaInvestor: Chen - no fibs
11:59 VolCrush: dat date brings earnings exposure
11:59 DrHouse: I am not a fibs guy either
11:59 AlphaInvestor: I don't even listen when der Fib King posts
11:59 JC_chart: fibs are amazingly  accurate for es, cl and gc futures
11:59 VolCrush: huh wat, did someone call

12:08 AlphaInvestor: Gross in his prime made money in bonds in bear markets, bull markets, sideways markets -- didn't matter
12:09 chenmann: he counted cards in college
12:09 radon224: ...and then he started talking to his cat and talking about it in his newsletters.  So it goes....

12:15 FrankB3:    13:12 vipin: that would be a very hard question to answer:  every trade has an opposite side....  try to stack the percentages in your favor
12:21 slagle: Who  is Ronco?  Is that a trading service?
12:23 FrankB3:   slagle: Mobius made up that name for a trade that takes care of itself..  set it and forget it...    like ITM covered call..  one day credit spread..
12:24 slagle: Ohh, thanks.  I get it
12:24 FrankB3:   I think he made a scan for it,,,  ask AI,, if he gets back
12:25 FrankB3:   He down in the storm ,,, somewere in S. C.
12:25 slagle: Ok, I think he said he is having internet trouble
12:26 FrankB3:   Yep he is always fooling around with them big trees...  I hope they did not fall on his internet
12:27 slagle: LOL  we are still getting rain bands here in SW Florida
12:27 FrankB3:   well good luck,,, hope it ends soon
12:27 slagle: thanks
12:28 streetglide: I wonder why such a lame day after yesterday
12:29 blondetrader: prob digesting 
12:30 Vimes: lame based on what measure?
12:30 blondetrader: dare I say tho small caps holding up ok
12:30 streetglide: lame based on es putting me asleep
12:31 Vimes: gotcha, pretty wide range today, maybe not compared to yesterday but vs history
12:32 radon224: I don't dare say anything in this market, lest it make me an instant fool
12:32 FrankB3:   ha
12:32 chenmann: lol radon....i could care less
12:33 Vimes: should wake up for you in the next 30 mins
12:33 radon224: I feel like I'm playing "Toss the Hand Grenade"
12:34 radon224: here...catch
12:34 blondetrader: lol
12:37 FrankB3:   I think you can compare this correction with downturn on 3/13/18 on daily SPX
12:40 streetglide: I asssume you mean in Feb 2018?.....March was a much smaller dip
12:41 VolCrush: true dat @Frank, it would have been nice, IMO, had /nq dropped another 100 either ON on on the open, now it's a wait and see on da close
12:45 fred__w: i see this as more similar to 2014-15  
12:46 Eedie: Watch the 200 dma or ema... for es
12:46 Eedie: It’s been gravitating to that line most of the day
12:46 fred__w: i only watch 11ema and to a lesser extent  the 44ema
12:47 fred__w: ..and of course  different index
12:47 Eedie: And according Nuggets wherever you are Nuggets they will try to keep it above that
12:47 Eedie: We shall see
12:47 chenmann: yes they waiting around 200 dma to see who s gonna make the first move
12:48 Eedie: Btw Hello Vol Bt Alpha Fred Chen Street
12:48 blondetrader: hi
12:48 Eedie: Had to run my mouth before saying hello I know typical female
12:48 Eedie: Hahahahha
12:48 fred__w: eed  yes  we will see  and gm
12:48 streetglide: ? for the option peeps........when looking at the volume column, say Puts,... is that for both bought and sold Puts?
12:48 chenmann: eedie hi, bet out of the way of michael
12:49 blondetrader: yes street
12:49 chenmann: get out
12:49 radon224: total traded street, both bot and sold
12:49 Eedie: We just got the winds and the rain
12:49 Eedie: I’m on west coast of Florida nowhere near the panhandle
12:49 streetglide: so you cant look at that and get much info out of that?
12:49 radon224: ya gotta be good at looking at OI to see how many were written, I never could figure it out
12:49 chenmann: oh cool eedie
12:50 radon224: well, total volume is useful for an options strike
12:50 radon224: liquidity
12:50 radon224: and interest
12:50 Eedie: I think there’s another tab on tos which shows you all of the activity for a particular option
12:51 chenmann: like all price action, if u follow it long enough u can see patterns....crooks like to hide
12:51 radon224: yes, on All Products you can drill down under "Todays Option Statistics" for more info
12:52 fred__w: chen  by that logic  we are all crooks
12:52 chenmann: dont know about u fred but im way too small to be a crook
12:53 radon224: I could be accused of Petty Theft at worst
12:53 fred__w: ..everyone knows we sorely needed a real correction  for eons  so  here it is
12:53 streetglide: I see that Radon, but still doesnt see bought or sold, just total
12:54 streetglide: see=say
12:55 fred__w: ..and  everyone knows that leadership has been drying up  again  for a long time
12:55 fred__w: ..if that is not adequate warning  i dont know what would be
12:57 chenmann: at the risk of being berged by admin, tos not so good for options trading, i use other options tools
12:57 chenmann: street
12:57 streetglide: heck, I thought that is what is was originally built for?
12:57 blondetrader: ohhhh
12:57 chenmann: cant list them here , sorry
12:58 fred__w: chen  folks have been trying to understand opyions  for eons  recalling black-scholes  for example
12:59 Vimes: i don't have any problem trading options in tos, think its very strong
12:59 fred__w: ..thats one reason i sticks with price only issues  thats hard enough
12:59 streetglide: think he was meaning info wise,Vimes
13:00 chenmann: yes
13:00 chenmann: but in fast markets , like this morning, tos laggs and freezes,
13:00 chenmann: sorry s=admin
13:01 streetglide: thats what I was going to say also
13:01 Vimes: yeah they need to fix that
13:01 streetglide: not going to apologize for their bad data servers
13:01 chenmann: haha
13:02 streetglide: its been like that for way too long
13:02 chenmann: i know a few people here dont trade on tos, just here to chat...lol
13:02 chenmann: not me
13:02 fred__w: chen  ok  but we accept responsible to trade  taking everything into acct  thats another reason im a position/ swing trader
13:03 fred__w: -ility*
13:03 chenmann: o ya, not blaming tos
13:03 streetglide: I am
13:03 chenmann: lol
13:03 chenmann: call trade desk , u may get some free trades
13:03 streetglide: who else's fault is it....I mean come on
13:04 fred__w: chen  if we look hard enough  we can always find warts  yet  we still engage  so  its on us if we persevere
13:05 streetglide: but I do like the charts and how you can set them......they just never address performance it seems
13:05 streetglide: and maybe its the language its written....I have no idea, not a techy
13:05 RandomDan: kinda surprised some life in gold.
13:05 fred__w: street  in such cases  knowing that  it pays to learn to trade off tables  like the old days
13:06 streetglide: uh no fred....just have more than one broker
13:07 chenmann: +
13:07 fred__w: thats another way to address things  of course
13:08 streetglide: which you would think TOS would address since they are losing some business
13:09 gerardom: this market is slow now ugh
13:09 fred__w: street  youre here  thats evidence youre ok with it  and  i am for sure
13:10 streetglide: 90% of my charts are here, so yes.......execute else where
13:11 streetglide: plus chat is good :)
13:11 yoz: what a morning.. was down $600 more after open then was up $600 30 mins later.. options were a bit volitle these past few days.. no thanks!
13:13 esmal: question

13:13 chenmann: we r in trouble
13:13 Ral: How I logout mobile
13:14 chenmann: sorry bulls in trouble
13:14 esmal: where does your money go when theta god takes it?
13:14 TheOnceAndFuture: to the writer
13:17 streetglide: Simone underrated, chen
13:17 chenmann: lol
13:18 VolCrush: indexes settin up for flush for second day, perhaps...
13:19 chenmann: one can only hope for a flush, this slow grind lower s not good for bulls or bears
13:19 fred__w: vol  no  just another test
13:20 VolCrush: welp path of least resistance and with all the big banks going 2morrow, market doesn't luk pleased, especially the tape on der FINS
13:21 streetglide: needs to bounce......exuberance is more fun
13:21 chenmann: i know vol, jpm action s like they gonna warn on er or something....maybe slower loan growth
13:22 chenmann: seeing slower loan growth
13:22 RandomDan: fins have been confusing me for many days now
13:23 chenmann: housing loans down for sure, but i think thats priced in, but if business loan growth is slowing or something....hmmm
13:23 streetglide: yep, shold be good with rising rates....but that chokes overall business so...
13:24 RandomDan: if loans are falling that should send a message to the Fed
13:24 chenmann: true
13:25 VolCrush: well i would think increased rates would off set some of the slow growth, but rumor has it economy is expanding, yet Marcos clearly stated in here ~ car sales sucked ~ data point
13:25 chenmann: oops
13:25 streetglide: I wonder if Fed is builing some cushion for next recession?
13:25 chenmann: something wrong with my keybroad
13:25 streetglide: building
13:26 DrHouse: Did you punch the keyboard
13:26 tmoney20g: its just all over the place
13:27 TheOnceAndFuture: street - that's been the idea
13:27 TheOnceAndFuture: They were way too slow to do it IMO
13:27 VolCrush: don't think SPX has much of a chance here
13:27 TheOnceAndFuture: waited until what, 2016?
13:27 chenmann: nope, its wireless , so maybe signal got mess up
13:28 chenmann: i m talking about my keybroad
13:28 TheOnceAndFuture: can anyone please tell me what "spuz" means?
13:28 streetglide: sounds dirty
13:28 chenmann: ha
13:28 TheOnceAndFuture: See it on trad flash all the time
13:28 vipin: amazon closed below 200 dma. I think it wants to go down more.
13:28 YClan: chen,  or battery in the keyboard is flake.
13:29 chenmann: oh nice yclan
13:29 TheOnceAndFuture: "/ES lots of neg ticks, spuz down 26 now"
13:29 Vimes: must mean the spx index
13:29 streetglide: yeah thats what I think
13:30 TheOnceAndFuture: I thought that myst be it, just never heard it called that
13:30 TheOnceAndFuture: must*
13:30 streetglide: kind of likes spoos
13:30 YClan: street,   Fed has to raise interest rates so they can lower them during next recession.  Also, FED still owns alot of USTreasuries that they printed money to buy and Fed has not sold those, so their balance is still bad because of that.
13:30 streetglide: yep
13:31 RandomDan: YClan they have been unwinding QE for a while now.
13:31 Vimes: do we get a new low or does it hold it in, its so exciting
13:32 RandomDan: I think rates are fine here till more data comes in. They should pause in december as planned.
13:32 streetglide: agree
13:32 blondetrader: 32 would b next es
13:32 RandomDan: As planned originally
13:32 TheOnceAndFuture: They should at least not talk about considering any future hikes until more data comes in
13:33 VolCrush: SPX cracked, luks like der fruit will crack 215 as well
13:33 YClan: Random,   They still own ALOT of USTreasureis.  At peak they owned $4.2 Tillion,   they sold some... but still own about 3.9 Trillion, so still own 90% of what they bought.
13:33 dragoon4zulu: any comments from potential margin calls re Ameritrade customer base?
13:33 VolCrush: spuz = spx
13:34 RandomDan: I swear, half the problems in the world are due to the fact that people like to talk more than they should
13:34 TheOnceAndFuture: Indeed
13:34 Vimes: dragon, not sure what that means - if you have a concern call the desk
13:35 YClan: later guys and gals... I'm going for a walkie
13:35 VolCrush: i think he / she is just trying to figure out how big an impact will  be on margin calls
13:35 chenmann: es broke glx low
13:35 VolCrush: /nq about to crack here as well, yup dar she goes
13:35 chenmann: vix

16:17 DrHouse: Or at least not from behind
16:18 VolCrush: no one is watchin you, pull yourself together
16:18 blondetrader: haha
16:18 streetglide: you will probably have ceo's downplaying the 4th qtr due to trade uncertainty/rates or whatever, which might keep a lid on things....they don't like to over promise
16:18 blondetrader: am just trying to play with the different things that can make mkt go boom
16:18 DrHouse: You mean to tell me that after all this time, MACD and TNT didn’t disappear from the chat room to just hide in my AC unit to watch me?

16:31 Anonymous so far: What do y&aposall think about SQ tomorrow? Down?
16:31 VolCrush: *histograms
16:31 JC_chart: i do actually sometimes but not in that image
16:31 VolCrush: i tink SQ has lost all or most of their top shelf managers, apparently der CEO is an arse
16:32 JC_chart: in that image I am showing two different histograms one driven on breadth and volume and one driven on price
16:32 VolCrush: wats the delta rthen from one histo to the other?
16:32 VolCrush: ah ok
16:32 JC_chart: the move
16:32 JC_chart: or momentum
16:33 JC_chart: but here let me do a fib one so you dont think i am bsing you one sec
16:33 VolCrush: momentum in volume? volume and breadth?
16:33 VolCrush: btw, you should be able to post the chart directly in here 
16:33 JC_chart: yes as a raw input that is transformed by the indicator
16:38 JC_chart: this is one of the GC trades i did
16:38 JC_chart: i tried to post it right in here but gave me a bad size
16:39 JC_chart: the entry was at one fib and exit at another
16:39 VolCrush: got it, thanks
16:40 JC_chart: my sq chart says it is flat lined in a range so hard to tell what will happen tomorrow
16:40 admin_tculs: JC  please do not post outside links here
16:41 JC_chart: well how do you post an image in her admin_TCULS
16:41 VolCrush: s/he is tryin to post the TOS chart in here, but I and others don't know how to do that
16:44 AlphaInvestor: JC - make your chart smaller before clippping - I use WinDoze 10 Snipping Tool. Then past into the chat box, right click and Zoom to 10%. Then hit send
16:45 VolCrush: ty, Alpha
16:45 JC_chart: how small
16:45 VolCrush: 10%
16:45 Gus: can't wait until eveything can be shorted with ease
16:46 AlphaInvestor: 640 x 640 I believe, but not sure
16:46 VolCrush: LOL, shorting for the last 3 days has been as easy as it gets
16:47 Gus: anybody a strictly short saler here?
16:47 VolCrush: or what, Alpha said
16:47 JC_chart: k
16:48 Gus: also yeah, but the consistency of being able to short all the time so not just 3 days lol
16:48 JC_chart: been able to short gold for a long time LOL
16:49 Gus: yes yes for sure but easier lol, i guess I'm not on the JC_chart level yet haha
16:49 AlphaInvestor: Gus - you can short most liquid things, those that are NTB or HTB, you can often go Synthetic Short via options
16:50 AlphaInvestor: Sell an ATM call, buy an ATM put - viola ... you are synthetic short stock
16:50 Gus: only have 18k and ive shorted $SUPV $MDXG $INNT & $BFR easy plays but as i get better I don't want to implode from lok
16:50 AlphaInvestor: I have a couple Call Credit Spreads on BFR -- bearish play
16:51 Gus: yeah i got out of it awhile back but thinking of heading back in soon
16:51 VolCrush: i tink he a penny scalper
16:52 Gus: not all the time haha but percentages are huge on plays like that
16:52 Gus: bfr went down like 15% in the last week, i shorted $SUPV instead and got 7% before it reversed and now its down another 7% since i left
16:53 AlphaInvestor: Vol - ah, CCS too commish intensive for penny scalping
16:53 AlphaInvestor: SUPV doesn't trade options, I cannot be short in my IRA
16:53 Gus: h&s pattern with a terrible downtrend on those stocks is a consistent play that I've made but don't wait long enough to realize
16:53 Gus: the best gainz
16:54 Gus: also, laugh if you'd like, ive never touched options haha
16:55 Gus: just basic shorting and longing, mostly shorting, as im better at that.
16:58 JC_chart: wow TOS sure does make it hard for you
16:58 VolCrush: chit bronx, AH moves e.g. AMZN*
16:59 JC_chart:  
16:59 JC_chart: OMG did that work
16:59 JC_chart: so vol that was an NVDA trade i took
17:00 JC_chart: entered when histos and trend line were green at the bottom of the range fib and exited at the 23.6
17:01 VolCrush: DAMN u did it, way to persevere
17:01 JC_chart: i am not sure if that was more frustrating or when the time and sales stopped today on gc LOL
17:07 AlphaInvestor: you missed the part about right clicking and scaling down to 10%
17:08 AlphaInvestor: That way you can post a slightly bigger chart, scaled down so it doesn't burn so much buffer
17:08 RandomDan: I am back.
17:09 AlphaInvestor: whew
17:10 RandomDan: I see I shouldn't have sold BABA
17:11 408Spartan: Any idea how to enable After Hours/ Pre Market prices for the tickers in MarketWatch?
17:12 JC_chart: I am not sure how to scale it down on my mac actually

17:30 chenmannmobile: nflx er 16th al
17:31 NullTrader: Hi I have a study that was created by my own code. I was able to edit it before. Now when I right click it, it only shows a "calculator" but no code to edit. What did I do wrong?
17:31 blondetrader: well fingers crossed
17:31 blondetrader: from these prices the long would be so much more awesome
17:34 408Spartan: JC_chart can you post a s creenshot of what youre seeing? I couldnt find it.
17:36 JC_chart: what im seeing  for what?
17:36 408Spartan: the Setting youre talking bout
17:36 VolCrush: meh, meh
17:37 RandomDan: gap up tomorrow becoming more plausible
17:37 chenmannmobile: buy baba back dan
17:37 chenmannmobile: ah
17:37 408Spartan: Apparently you cant or so says Support "Hello! Sorry about the wait. Afterhours prices you will look at the bid and ask."
17:38 VolCrush: pics from bronx, becoming a 98% probibility with IV of 2%
17:38 AlphaInvestor: 408 - wrong!!
17:38 AlphaInvestor: But support don't know diddly some times
17:38 JC_chart: im short gc at 1227
17:38 amalia: Buy /YM
17:38 RandomDan: too late, sold at 141.90
17:39 RandomDan: I am not buying back at a loss
17:39 JC_chart: target is 1226. but might not get there on 1st try
17:39 408Spartan: AlphaInvestor thats what I thought i mean its a pretty simple utility just goddamn hard to find tht Setting
17:39 AlphaInvestor: 408 - add a new custom column - I named mine myLast ... put a single word inside    CLOSE   ... set the aggregation to 1 minute using the little box that defaults to D (daily)
17:39 RandomDan: I am long plenty of other stuff
17:40 amalia: 61 t trail
17:41 blondetrader: gc drop to 20
17:41 JC_chart: 404spart do you see the gear in your tooldbar header a
17:41 JC_chart: haha
17:41 AlphaInvestor:  
17:41 JC_chart: im hoping that for you with rty
17:41 blondetrader: and tomorrow if below that 1213
17:41 RandomDan: JC I think you will make money short gc
17:41 AlphaInvestor: 408 - also, make sure you click the box for EXT hours
17:42 AlphaInvestor: right click that post, zoom up to 100%
17:42 blondetrader: will prob do gc short tomorrow
17:42 amalia: P shape from 24,893
17:42 amalia: Intraday
17:43 VolCrush: i noticed the move in /gc today, kinda scratched myself but the $$$$ did dip a bit; inflation worries all over
17:43 JC_chart: I dont know  gc hit 126.6 5 times now  and my chart is now  has conflict
17:43 VolCrush: listening to the Grateful Dead eating pistachio ice cream
who, who has it better than us?
17:44 AlphaInvestor: NOBODY
17:44 JC_chart: i think it was the shorts covering after  the hbid up last night and early this morning and some hedging too
17:45 RandomDan: gc was just a fear play IMHO, fear be dissipating. It's not a good inflation hedge even if inflation actually became a thingm
17:45 AlphaInvestor: Timberland is a great inflation hedge! And I know just the guy ...
17:45 JC_chart: dont disagree but the market players become irrational on days like to day so....
17:46 RandomDan: yeah but if the market rises tomorrow, gc goes back to sleep
17:47 JC_chart: ya know GC has always a few great day trades every day
17:47 RandomDan: I don't really follow it. It's just on my watchlist for context.
17:48 JC_chart: and if youre right, it will march back to 1165 or so and that could be a good bit of trading to there
17:48 JC_chart: i like trading cl too but sometimes it is just too   whiphot and wicky candles so i trade gc
17:49 AlphaInvestor: Well, it was real today. Later Traders
17:49 JC_chart: I dont like es as i it is expensive and actually doesnt have that many great moves except when a plunge happens
17:49 RandomDan: No idea. I think it's going to hang around 1200, but no reasoning behind that.
17:49 chenmannmobile: later al
17:49 RandomDan: later Al
17:49 VolCrush: /cl is the most news driven product out there, to trade /cl you must follow the news on /cl and global macros
17:50 RandomDan: the mood in the room is different tonight. yesterday most of us were shell shocked
17:50 JC_chart: I just follow my chart for cl
17:50 JC_chart: when things agree and there is a fib range go in
17:50 JC_chart: there are usually 10 or so trades a day on the 3m
17:51 RandomDan: cl... I have no edge at all. Would never try it.
17:51 JC_chart: my charts have the edge
17:51 RandomDan: I don't know how many tankers are parked wherever... how many rigs this and that.
17:52 JC_chart: don't really give a you know what ... my chart indicators agree there i is a trade i take it as i beleive in my charts
17:53 JC_chart: not saying that with any obnoxiousness just saying that is the truth
17:53 chenmannmobile: i only trade cl during war
17:53 chenmannmobile: any war
17:53 RandomDan: Whatever works for you man.
17:53 JC_chart: i lost a lot of money  disagreeing with my chart and not beleiveing in my system ... once i paid attention and trusted my system its been great
17:53 RandomDan: war, charts, loaded dice
17:55 chenmannmobile: cnbc special, was today s flush the bottom?
17:55 RandomDan: 
17:56 blondetrader: ugh
17:57 RandomDan: my sense, and take it for what its worth, is tomorrow is big bounce #1, but I have no idea if it will hold (or even happen, just the voice in my head)
17:58 chenmannmobile: did fill that gap es 2713, and bounced right off
17:58 RandomDan: Also, while I am playing a clairvoyant trader on TV, I would look for GOOG close to 1120
17:59 RandomDan: 1115 maybe. Something like that.
18:00 VolCrush: welp, if CNBS said that, we have 500 points more to the downside   
18:00 RandomDan: Of course ERs could be awful and the whole house of cards goes to the floor.
18:00 VolCrush: or short the gap up, LOL
18:00 RandomDan: What are those fine folks saying?
18:01 VolCrush: or read the *ucking tape
18:01 chenmannmobile: "it s time to nibble" cramer
18:01 VolCrush: i would never much less take a bite out of Cramer
18:01 VolCrush: *I would never nibble...
18:01 RandomDan: Cramer would be good if he didn't push his book so much.
18:01 VolCrush: really is he tasty
18:02 VolCrush: ??
18:02 RandomDan: I like the guy. It's like having an uncle who's a used car salesman.
18:03 VolCrush: you shouldn't refer to Marcos that way
18:04 RandomDan: I wouldn't buy a car from him but I like the stories.
18:05 chenmannmobile: o wow futures up lot....so far
18:06 blondetrader: shhh
18:06 blondetrader: they will hear u
18:07 chenmannmobile: cramer thinks most aggressive selling is over.....
18:07 tmoney20g: chen just likes the full body shot of seema
18:08 chenmannmobile: need to remove the moving tocker
18:08 chenmannmobile: ticker
18:08 tmoney20g: i like this cnbc encore instead of shark tank
18:11 tmoney20g: gonna be buyers tomorrow boize
18:11 tmoney20g: get those calls cued up
18:11 amalia: Going for 100 ticks
18:12 JC_chart: you guys are very entertaining thanks for a great day .. I am going to go to the gym
18:13 blondetrader: see ya
18:13 JC_chart: ohh and  on that RTY i will be rooting for you
18:14 blondetrader: thx :)
18:18 amalia: 352 and I’ll leave one trailing
