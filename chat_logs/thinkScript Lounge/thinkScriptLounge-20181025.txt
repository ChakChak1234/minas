12:51 Mobius: FE is really simple - High reading market flat and building energy. Low reading Market trending and expending energy. nothing more to it
12:54 FrankB3:    Thanks  Mr. Mo:: but a question on trade strategy:::  If a trader used a short term swing trade, say 3% profit or market on close on 3rd day:: could he make as much profit as long term holder of stocks, if his method had a high win rate???
13:13 Mobius: If such a trade system could be maintained
13:23 ChartChick: can anyone tell me how to watch CNBC News while watching my stock chart? I can't see what's going on while monitoring my stock... thanks
13:24 JohnnyQuotron: Mobius... if the OneNote had a Combined Signal Approach Section would that script belong in it?
13:25 amalia: Si
13:34 JohnnyQuotron: amalia.. is that Si 4 me?
13:35 amalia: Yes. It has CSA in the title and the section you're asking about is all about CSA so I say it fits well in that section.
13:37 JohnnyQuotron: Gratias tibi ago..
13:40 Blue_Oyster_Cult-: DId Doc leave DK ?
13:42 FrankB3: Anyway CSA sounds more scientifically from what I called "compound indicators" .   I think an example would be TTM_Squeeze or the P3_Squeeze ???  but I'm not scientifically, what ever that means
13:50 lawrence5684: Under the Analyze tab, under Positions and Simulated Trades, there are MODEL and INTEREST.  What model is best for projecting potential gains or losses on an individual stock for which put options are held?  What does INTEREST mean?  How do I use INTEREST in predicting potential outcomes for options held in a particular stock?
13:52 Vimes: Use teh default setting of Bjerksund-Stensland, and in my opinion teh interest impact is going to be the least important factor versus all the factors that influence option pricing
13:54 lawrence5684: Thank you VImes.  Actually that makes sense on the interest.  
14:02 bigworm: mobius you ever hear of using kernelized ridge regression as a classifier?
14:15 MTS1: BOC; check out his linked in page; and no mention of him in recend dk vids
14:16 Nube: Twas I who mentioned yesterday being bullish.
14:16 MTS1: ChartChick; If you want to watch it separately you can select 'detach' to have it in separate window. If you want to see what's going on find something else though;)
14:16 Nube: I think I might have been wrong. Still 45 minutes yet though...
14:17 MTS1: lol nube
14:17 Joebone87: nube...
14:17 Vimes: Thought you were selling from the top of that candle
14:17 Joebone87: i think the pipe bombs might have spoiled your rally
14:17 MTS1: I made up for yesterday, so I'm happier;)
14:18 MTS1: huh; missed something I guess Joe.
14:19 Joebone87: lol
14:19 Nube: Vimes, I did but not with much conviction.
14:19 MTS1: saw somethign bout him but that's it; not paying attention as I don't see that impacting mkts. Will check news later.
14:20 admin_bkTOS: Please keep discussions thinkScript related
14:20 Nube: Will do, admin. Sorry.
14:20 Joebone87: sorry
14:23 MTS1: /vx not even breaching yesterday's high, barely ORH. .
14:36 Blue_Oyster_Cult-: 5 MTS1: BOC; check - thanks
14:37 Vimes: i wanted lower prices to start buying again, but know that its happening not so easy
14:37 Vimes: ^know = now,
14:41 FrankB3:    10:50 Paris: if you get a chance: do you  have any  "price cycle indicator""  or any thing that acts like such besides these;;, I was told some of these are not true cycle indiators, thanks..     http://tos.mx/nWV2sK#
14:44 Nube: Still 15 minutes yet for to close green.
14:44 Vimes: so you're saying theres a chance
14:46 FrankB3:   maybe two chances
14:57 MTS1: Vimes; have a suspicion we may not be done yet
14:57 Vimes: yep me too,
14:59 Nube: Still not limit now so we have hope.
15:03 Mobius: We touched 10% off the top /ES and bounced
15:04 Mobius: Almost made T10
15:04 Nube: That's gotta be a once per year kind of day
15:05 Vimes: to the tick impressive
15:05 JohnnyQuotron: Ouch...  5 minute chart?  T5 on the 10min
15:06 Nube: Emerging markets down a third as much as ES and a quarter as much as NQ.
15:07 Nube: After underperforming for 10 years, they have become the safe trade.
15:07 JohnnyQuotron: MoMo Oh No
15:07 Nube: And Bitcoin
15:07 JohnnyQuotron: bidding for msft at 95
15:07 bigworm: what is yoru take there mobius
15:08 FrankB3:     There was a time, I thought, when not being in a trade each week, was disturbing....  some how lost my greed
15:09 Vimes: TD to allow trading through ALEXA
15:09 Nube: Alexa, short me some spus
15:10 Vimes: what could possibly go wrong
15:12 JohnnyQuotron: you know if Jay Powell comes out tomorrow and says the fed is not locked into raising rates in each on the next six quarters and is in fact looking at trade issues and is data dependant the S&P will be up 300-500
15:13 JohnnyQuotron: Quote of the day....."Thank you sir, may I have another."  
15:17 Vimes: There was a random request yesterday for a pine script translation so starting poking around for other interesting scripts, thought this was an interesting take on a donchian type channel:

 
#Source idea from "eykpunter" on trading view
#transalted to to tos
#Fib Zone Channels
#vimes
#18/10/24
input per=21;
plot hl=highest(high[1],per);
plot ll=lowest(low[1],per);
def dist=hl-ll;
plot hf=hl-dist*0.236;
plot cfh=hl-dist*0.382;
plot cfl=hl-dist*0.618;
plot lf=hl-dist*0.764;
hl.SetDefaultColor(color = Color.GRAY);
ll.SetDefaultColor(color = Color.GRAY);
hf.SetDefaultColor(color = Color.GRAY);
cfh.SetDefaultColor(color = Color.GRAY);
cfl.SetDefaultColor(color = Color.GRAY);
lf.SetDefaultColor(color = Color.GRAY);
addcloud(hl,hf,color.light_green);
addcloud(cfh,cfl,color.light_gray);
addcloud(lf,ll,color.light_red);
15:24 FrankB3: Thanks  Vimes,   intresting
15:28 Vimes: Perhaps another interesting take, using two lookbacks
#"[RS]Support and Resistance V0"
#Port of public tradingview script from R Santos
#Donchian Style Channels
#coded in TOS
input window1 = 8;
input window2 = 21;
plot top1 = highest(high, window1);
plot bot1 = lowest(low, window1);
plot top2 = highest(high, window2);
plot bot2 = lowest(low, window2);
top1.setdefaultColor(color.white);
top2.setdefaultColor(color.white);
bot1.setdefaultColor(color.white);
bot2.setdefaultColor(color.white);
addcloud(top2,top1,Color.light_orange);
addcloud(bot1,bot2,color.light_green);
15:32 growex: Hello everyone here. Could someone please answer why if i start to calculate volume data from tading session start as a cumulative sum, i have big difference between daily volume data and my calculations?
15:36 Vimes: perhaps it is not including pre-market volume?
15:38 growex: Hi Vimes, i've checked it but it still differs so much...
15:40 growex: and open time on daily bar differs with open of first premarket bar....
15:43 Mobius: hey growex - if it's furtures your checking TOS volume reports all active contracts. cumulative volume doesn't unless you add all separtely then combine them
15:43 Nube: That issue had come up before and the answer was no. There must be some data reported in the daily money that isn't reported to their intraday bars.
15:44 Nube: Now that's a much better answer
15:44 growex: Thank you
15:50 FrankB3: To anyone knowledge would it be possible to count waves on a CCI :;      http://tos.mx/QLO0Ls#
15:50 Vimes: doesn't seem to match on stocks either, curious
15:54 Vimes:  
23.8M vs 27.5M on FB
16:01 growex: Yes Vimes i meant stocks. But....i've found now that aftermarket volumes keeps adding to daily volume data but OHLC remains the same as trading session ohlc....at least on Ford Motor i'm looking at now
16:02 Vimes: not sure, do you have extended hours sown on your daily candle? for me its still incrementing
16:02 Vimes:  
16:04 growex: i have extended hours on 1 min chart and there is a new low but daly bar remains with trading session low
16:06 Vimes: well i don't know the internals of the program so admit its curious, not sure its enough to worry about, sorry i couldn't help further
16:06 growex: Vimes thank you.
16:07 growex: at least i can compare this with someones else data
16:09 Vimes: one final comment if you use the built in volume study, there is no discrepancy
16:20 Vimes: Not a holy grail but an interesting trade idea to create a band around the RSI with a middle "dispersion" dead zone to filter trades, backtest is spotty depending on time frame chosen - with some horrendous drawdowns but was a curiosity to me, two studies included, one as the lower stand alone study, second is the backtest strategy:
http://tos.mx/PUd46g#
16:21 Farmin: As Nube stated above, aggregated volume bars for the day have already been shown to not equal the volume reported by the daily volume bar.  I've never seen an explanation as to why or what the difference is
16:43 Farmin: also ToS calls their built-in Donchian channels study 'Price Channels'  Not sure why...
17:21 Nube: VIMES YOU BRILLIANT SOB
17:57 amalia: That he is.
18:01 Vimes: well not really my work, credit is in the header of the studies, but thanks
19:01 JohnnyQuotron: I clearly have some catching up to do this evening.
19:45 John1a: Vimes: Really great stuff. Thank you very much!
19:46 admin_tculs: thinkScript Lounge chatroom will be closing soon  Please finish all conversations by 8pm ct    Have a nice evening
19:47 John1a: Pine people produce some really interesting scripts
19:50 John1a: Would be very intetesting to see strategies for those two other studies.
19:58 Vimes: Alot depends on how you would define the entries, but assuming entry above the breach of the middle channel coudl be something like this:
#
#Fib Zone Channels - Strategy
input per = 21;
input osize = 5; #hint :osize # of contracts
plot hl = Highest(high[1], per);
plot ll = Lowest(low[1], per);
def dist = hl - ll;
plot hf = hl - dist * 0.236;
plot cfh = hl - dist * 0.382;
plot cfl = hl - dist * 0.618;
plot lf = hl - dist * 0.764;
AddCloud(hl, hf, Color.LIGHT_GREEN);
AddCloud(cfh, cfl, Color.LIGHT_GRAY);
AddCloud(lf, ll, Color.LIGHT_RED);
def long = if close crosses above cfh then 1 else 0;
def short = if close crosses below cfl then 1 else 0;
addOrder(OrderType.BUY_AUTO, long, open[-1],osize, color.cyan, color.cyan, "Channel:LE");
AddOrder(OrderType.SELL_AUTO, short,open[-1],osize,color.yellow, color.yellow, name = "Channel:SE");

08:21 ZupDog: Vimes,  Thanks for sharing your RSI_BB_DISPERSIONZone studies last nite.  Very nice studies indeed!  I took the liberty to convert the lower study into a Label Study.  Hope you do not mind.    For those interested, here is the script for the Label Study conversion:         
#RSI with BollingerBands and Dispersion Zone
#script ported from free tradingview script (Author: Mr Mozart)
#Vimes
#Converted to Label Study by ZupDog
input price = close;
input rsi_len = 14;
input ma_len = 20;
input mult = 2; #hint mult:Multipler for StdDev bands
input dispersion = 0.1; #hint dispersion:Define dispersion zone
input colorbars = yes; #hint colorbars:Color bars based on RSI
def rsi = RSI(rsi_len, price = price);
def basis = ExpAverage(rsi, ma_len);
def dev = mult * StDev(rsi, ma_len);
def upper = basis + dev;
def lower = basis - dev;
def disp_up = basis + ((upper - lower) * dispersion);
def disp_down = basis - ((upper - lower) * dispersion);
#assignpricecolor(if colorbars then if rsi>disp_up then color.BLUE else if rsi<disp_down then color.RED else color.lIGHT_GRAY else color.CURRENT);
AddLabel(yes, "RSIwBB&DZ " , if colorbars then if rsi > disp_up then Color.BLUE else if rsi < disp_down then Color.RED else Color.ORANGE else Color.CURRENT);
     
08:32 stevie_s: .
08:33 growex: Vimes, i ve seen that rsi-bb a few yrs ago. even posted it on some forum... :) So be careful with it and dont trade real money by its signals
08:35 growex: the main problem witjh it - the algo of wilders average. If you choose simple MA, the picture changes dramaticaly
08:37 growex: Simply look at your study in realtime and you'll know what i'm talking about. ))
09:04 Vimes: Sure, growex, just things that looked interesting and thought i would share.   I wouldn't expect anybody to just randomly trade based on a posted study
09:05 MoMo: Does anyone have a strategy for the ORB (opening range breakout) or any backtesting results ?
09:10 Paris: I recall that Mobius posted an ORB Strategy several years ago, not sure if he has an updated version to align with his new version of ORB. You might check in with him
09:12 MTS1: Believe there are notes in his ORB study with suggestions on how to trade it.
09:15 JohnnyQuotron: Morning all.    I have a few ORB scans in the OneNote.
09:25 Paris: The question was about ORB strategy, rather than a scan/study
09:43 MoMo: Thank you all
09:50 MontyTheLab: How long does it take for a support ticket to be addressed?
09:50 MontyTheLab: (in general)

10:01 profit_recon: hey guys anyone have supply demand support script
10:02 Mobius: I've been blinded
10:02 profit_recon: im new to scripts so hopeing i can find something someone has done before to test and then reverse engineer
10:02 profit_recon: sry better?
10:02 Mobius: no
10:03 Mobius: No color in this room. Unless for teaching
10:03 profit_recon: ok
10:04 profit_recon: does anyone have script for supply demand zones? i can use to get started with then configure as needed?
10:04 Mobius: There's no need for reverse engineering anything in ThinkScript. Except for just a few studies It's all open source

10:06 profit_recon: wow thanks mobius thats awsome let me give it a try
10:07 profit_recon: i gave u a follow
10:08 Mobius: yw
10:10 profit_recon: ok helpful but not quite what im looking for.
10:10 profit_recon: can i post images on here
10:11 MoMo: yes - just reduce the size before posting
10:12 mcdon0301: Any of you guys know why a custom script shows on mobile but not pc ?
10:13 profit_recon: ok give me a minute
10:13 profit_recon: i have issue where i can see volumeprofile on pc but not mobile
10:17 mcdon0301: That’s weird I’ll hit up support
10:21 MTS1: Mcdon; normally scripts are more restrictive on mobile; maybe a setting?
10:21 MTS1: or time frame; some don't work on tick charts for example
10:23 profit_recon: what size does img need to be
10:24 RogueOneTrader: I was wondering does anyone have a scan for hidden divergence for RSI and/or Stochastic.
10:25 MTS1: profit; 600x600 I believe. Then before hitting enter right-click and zoom to 10%
10:26 profit_recon:  
10:26 profit_recon: anyone have something like this for supply demand zones
10:27 profit_recon: i found forum and they had something like this but the other guy didnt share his just the photo

10:28 Mobius: Talk about a kludge
10:29 profit_recon: here was text
10:29 profit_recon: I have something like this.... Records the last 50 swing highs and lows.
Took over 2500 lines of brute force coding to get this accomplished in�TOS�though.
It took A LOT of work to get this done, and it's not currently available to the public, but I'm showing that it CAN be done.
10:30 profit_recon: would be super awsome have something like this but have same thing with mobius where u can change how many swings maybe from 50 to 10 etc
10:30 Mobius: That isn't a Supply Demand study. It's a pivot study. TOS has one in Patterns. There's also several others in MyTrade. Any of them can draw the lines with clouds to whatever pretty colors and widths you wish. But that's just eye candy and has nothing to do with anything.
10:33 profit_recon: right now i use pivot points and volume profile but i feel like im getting beat up on my trades due to not knowing supply demand areas. i trade options very short time period mainly by direction. my trades are usually 90% winners if i can stomach the loss against me within short time period. i was trying have some supply demand locations to help better my enteries so my im trading is more accurate to next move.
10:34 profit_recon: something for the 5min 15 min charts
10:34 Vimes: Profit, look on Mobius, mytrade for something around support/resistance - should match
10:34 profit_recon: ok thanks will check it out
10:35 Nube: I think I might have a pivot profiles script of some sort using Mobius fractal pivots to define the pivots. I'm not going g to do the work to define 50 of them but that will show you how to do it.
10:35 profit_recon: yes if you can id appreciate it
10:36 Vimes: yes - that's likely what i meant - just couldn't remember the title
10:36 Mobius: This study actually plots areas of interest for supply and demand
10:38 Nube: Needs way more clouds and lines, Mobius. It's practically useful as it is now.
10:39 Mobius: lol  But it does make the areas of excess supply plain to see
10:39 LBK: good, where to find the script for supply and demand? can share 🤗
10:39 Mobius: Trade Breakouts - That's the objective
10:41 LBK: supply and demand has many time frames. lower time frames full of noises
10:42 profit_recon: yes i need for short time periods i think can help my timing for enteries. cause like i said i am 90% right in direction but my timing kills me where i suffer -$0.20+ paper loss on options prior to hitting my target. I need just a lil more zoomed in visual to support timing of entry 
10:45 LBK: I use OTCS supply and demand weekly and daily yo trade my option and future. short time frame is very hard.
10:46 Nube: Yeah, it's does seem to make it pretty darned clear where the bodies are.
10:47 LBK: Moebius, your plot on the supply and demand script fully developed?
10:48 Mobius: No - I always post half baked ideas
10:49 LBK: Nube: OTCS Refer to on line trading academy. You can either plot your own or a quick share from their daily publish..as a life member.. I can access daily
10:52 Nube: If you need half baked ideas, I'm your guy.
10:53 profit_recon: wow first time i am looking at mythink great  thanks guys for all contributions you make !!
10:54 profit_recon: what would u suggest for me to use then just to help better time entries for exteremly short time fram enteries fractal pivots. just checking mobius supertrend now
10:55 MTS1: profit; please exit and re-enter the room to fix your font
10:55 profit_recon: is it fixed
10:55 MTS1: For extremely short term I suspect price is your best bet
10:56 MTS1: and levels; any levels will probably do. I've seen traders use static price level increments, roundies, etc.
10:57 DMonkey: If you have to ask, your not ready.
10:57 MTS1: but if you have not found fractal pivots that was mentioned find that on Mobius MyTrade.
10:57 MTS1: True DM
10:57 profit_recon: im asking so i can continue learning and improve skill. Everyday is a chance to get better.
10:57 profit_recon: ok will check out suggestions
10:58 MTS1: And as Mobius and others state; the shorter the timeframe the more random price; iow indicators will help less and less the shorter timeframe you trade on; price is your best bet (and not delayed).
10:59 Mobius: Nice comment MTS1 - Frame that one and repost at will :)
10:59 70cuda: Not sure what I'm doing wrong.  In TOS help cetner there is a script for getting the ATM option code as follows:Example 1input expirationDate = 20120421;
AddLabel(IsOptionable(), "ATM Call option is " + GetATMOption(GetUnderlyingSymbol(), expirationDate, OptionClass.CALL));
11:00 70cuda: But when I put in 20181102 as the date I get nothing returned
11:00 70cuda: ?
11:03 MTS1: cuda; exit and reenter please to fix your font.
11:03 70cuda: it is fixed
11:03 MTS1: Before copying and pasting; use notepad or turn off bold/italixs/underline to fix before enter.
11:03 MTS1: What ticker are you trying this on
11:03 70cuda: SPY

11:05 Mobius: That study takes a minute to start showing results. Has to do with how TOS pushes data to ThinkScript not the study.

11:05 Mobius: yw cuda... Hard not to help a 70cuda. Killer ride
11:06 Mobius: almost as good as a 68 Z28
11:07 alx: Hello, Is there a way of pulling premarket volume of a ticker to excel. ?
11:09 70cuda: ;)...gotmy 70cuda up for sale...my riding buddy who had the 70 challenger passed...so it is not the same really.  on ebay for those that want some real fun ;)

11:11 70cuda: 70Cuda reef...i like it
11:12 Mobius: I tried to get the state to allow me to be stuffed and setup like driving it but they said that was just to Knappy. They didn't buy the whole mummy thing
11:14 70cuda: :o
11:16 70cuda: Any clue why the TOS snippet didn't work?
11:20 Nube: Idea: Taxidermy you guys in the passenger seat and then your kids can use the car pool lanes.
11:20 Tidetrader18: Going back to a question asked earlier by (rogue one trader) about anyone having a scan for hidden divergence for RSI and or stochastic ?
11:23 Nube: 68 was the first yet without wing (leak) windows, I think. Did that year have the same parking lights as 67?
11:28 bmckinney: Can you only be allowed a limited number of "Custom Quotes" on the watchlist?
11:30 MTS1: you'll get warnings or n/a if you have too many data queries
11:31 MTS1: Also there's a limited number of custom quote columns that get exported wiht RTD; but you can add more.
11:31 MTS1: (By importing shared quotes)
11:31 bmckinney: How do you add more?
11:31 MTS1: *quote columns
11:37 Mobius: Nube yes - white parking lights on 68 and 67
11:38 Mobius: Only original 19 columns will export data to RTD
11:44 bmckinney: Why only 19? You can't do anymore than that?
11:45 Farmin: its the rules
11:46 bmckinney: Boooooo! Thanks :)

12:08 growex: Frank..i have one.. :)
12:08 growex: ohhhh i'm very sorry
12:08 anthony0515: How do you chaps cope with "custom Expresion sun limit exeeded"?
12:09 FrankB3:   Thanks, Mr. Mo,,,,  and just made .77 in 30 min with the RSI_Lagueree thingy ,, thanks again
12:09 DMonkey: just use an old Frank.....Recycle
12:11 Mobius: anthony - There is no coping with it. Your client limit is done. Delete some active watchlists, charts, studies or whatever it takes to get below your limit
12:12 Mobius: TOS data is Free. So they limit each client
12:13 MTS1: BMC; again that is refering to RTD; is that what you're doing? You can add more in wathlist by importing custom columns but they won't export.
12:13 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current.  BBL
12:17 FrankB3:   growex:  please post a small picture,,  what is that thing?
12:17 anthony0515: Tanks for confirming what I thought.
12:18 growex: Frank it is by mistake..wrong paste.
12:31 cajun: this candle action is creepy.. anyone's indicator explainingg it?
12:45 FrankB3:  cajun::  what u look at?
12:48 Vflag: don't work
12:49 Mobius: lol  Random comments
12:54 amalia: I like turtles.
12:55 hguru: someone asked about a CCI study the other day here is one Mobius did a few years ago Mobius_SimplifiedChannelIndex_CCI   http://tos.mx/tQwH8s#
12:57 VW212: Hi Mobius, I just emailed you :)
13:00 cajun: Frank, we goin up on slooow, w low volume, seems no commitment...
13:01 Tidetrader18: Can anyone tell me where I might find bullish/bearish stoch scans? thanks!
13:01 cajun: im fraid of another 150 pt fall
13:04 woodie: gotta love the cci
13:07 FrankB3: Hey woodie::  to your knowledge has any one  tried counting waves on a CCI??   Sort of like Elliot waves?
13:08 woodie: hi frank
13:09 woodie: yes but was done using trendlines as waves
13:10 woodie: trend lines on the indicator itself and if i remember right trend lines had to start from points ar extreme above 200
13:10 woodie: diff not a wave guytho
13:11 amalia: FrankB3, this may be the time to start learning how to code
13:11 amalia: We can go slow or fast. However you want.
13:11 FrankB3: Yes, had a mentor for credit spreads who always use trendlines for entries on the CCI(20)
13:12 MTS1: Trendlines ON the cci, or on price?
13:12 woodie: i have some who use trend lines on my cci to hedge ...1 contacts me about once a year a hog farmer
13:13 woodie: on cci
13:13 FrankB3: amalia: I'm afraid I'll never come out of that rabbit hole
13:13 MTS1: Right Woodie; not sure if Frank got that;)
13:13 woodie: thanks MTS1
13:13 MTS1: (Regarding his mentor)
13:14 hguru: here is  a MACD study i had in my index i thought I would share MACD_TwoColor2Line http://tos.mx/CzXE8I#
13:19 amalia: FrankB3, let's start today.
13:26 FrankB3:  Trying to run a business, I started in same location, scince 1969,..  but I am learning by listien to you guys,,, little by little... get too many crazy ideas
13:28 amalia: We can start with the Fundamental functions like Open, High, Low, Close, HL2, HLC3, OHLC4.
13:28 FrankB3: MTS: mentor good, stoped teaching, bought a house on Lake Mich. and now runs a prop firm,,,  well I guess he is teaching: have to apply his trade plan ??
13:29 amalia: These functions have 3 inputs: Symbol, Period, PriceType.
13:29 amalia: We usually just mess with the first two.
13:30 amalia: Mainly Period, the 2nd input.
13:31 bmckinney: How would I manually type "shares" into my script? Is that possible? For instance, "shares > 1000000"
13:34 MTS1: no way to make up your own syntax; have to follow TOS's
13:35 MTS1: And no context to your inquiry so not sure what you're trying to do.
13:35 MTS1: (If you defined "shares" you may have something;))
13:35 MTS1: ^BMC
13:38 FrankB3:   sorry amalia,,,  can't  concentrate,, business have been going down for years,,,  now is the time to test a trading plan.   I think short term swing trades, with a good cycle indicator.
13:41 MTS1: What type of bus Frank?
13:41 MTS1: biz
13:42 Mobius: VW212 - Heads up
13:43 FrankB3:  retail work uniforms::  traveled around in a bet up Volks wagen van sellining rental work pants for $1.00
13:45 amalia: I've just explained the easiest thing ever on this platform. I've seen you talk about more sophisticated studies. Gonna be hard to get people to work or indulge you without a little knowledge of thinkScript. imo
13:46 Mobius: gotta sell a boat load of britches at a buck a piece to earn a living
13:46 FrankB3:    Plus drinking and gambling
13:47 Mobius: There's child labor laws that make employers pay better than that
13:48 Mobius: gotta hand it to you Frank - you must be one persistent guy
13:53 FrankB3:   Thanks, amalia:  you have convinced me to learn,,,,  I will put some time aside each night for learning and thanks for helping me with some crazy ideas,, especially Mr. Mo and many others,,,  I still have some of their early scrips,  when I got kicked out of chat 10 years ago
13:59 FrankB3:   MR> MO:::   The only problem with a good cycle indicators is that ::  temporary price bottoms on a chart look like double bottoms on cycle indictor.  IE  bought MSFT @ 107.01 around  12:15 est.  How do know what bottom to take:   http://tos.mx/niJ5A2#
14:02 John1a: Frank: There are no bottoms per se or tops, just balance and imbalance.
14:05 FrankB3: Just before the imbalance I would like to buy
14:06 John1a: Frank: Funny, get in line :) The trick is knowing which one to choose, there are many and they are dynamic
14:08 John1a: As a very general rule, for a given price distribution, you want to buy above a VWAP and sell below it, but this is very high level, there are many details in between
14:09 FrankB3:   Well I hope Mr. Mo new cycle indicator will factor in thoes price bottoms that are close together
MovingAvgCrossover
14:10 John1a: There is no holly grail indicator that can do that. Market wouldn't exist if there was one
14:11 FrankB3:   ah, John, you just killed my hopes,,  
14:11 John1a: On a very basci level the price moves away from one place of "agreement" (balance/VWAP or POC) to another.
14:12 John1a: Or maybe I gave you hope that you can learn why the price moves the way it does and then you don't need an indicator.
14:13 mthfr_vaxxed: or you can monitor the news... wait for crazy events like october 4th bloomberg article...and start shorting
14:13 FrankB3:   Sounds almost like support and restanresistance ????
14:14 AJayKC: i have had no success creating a scan that will result in stocks whose 50 simnple moving average is above 200. and the price "last" is near its 200 sma.
14:14 AJayKC: does somebody have it made already or can bistow me some guidance please?
14:14 John1a: Frank: I use indicators but as tools. Like you would use a soap to wash your hands, but you know how to wash your hands, the soap is just a tool that makes it easier
14:15 AJayKC: any help is much appreciated.
14:15 amalia: Define "near"
14:16 AJayKC: movingavgcrossover ( "l1" = 1 , "l2" = 195 , "crossing type" = "below" ) is true.
14:16 John1a: Frank: If you want to learn from one of the best look up Verniman on Google
14:16 AJayKC: something like that amalia. i don't want it coming from below 200 sma.
14:17 AJayKC: i prefer which is about to touchl
14:18 MTS1: Ajay; that is crossing over; different than above / below.
14:19 MTS1: You can have 2 scan filters; one checking for one MA being above another, second for price being close to MA.
14:19 FrankB3:   John,,, I agree..  Once knew a trader who VWAP in weekly SPX credit spreads,,, before it became popular...  may still have his course on VHS tape... I think Shadow Trader talks about it alot ???
14:20 MTS1: The built-in moving average scan will cover the price part, the MA above another I believe is there also or can easilly be built in the builder.
14:20 FrankB3:   Thanks John
14:20 MTS1: if you want moving avg crossover that's biult in also; but unlikely to find price close to slow MA as fast one is crossing over.
14:22 John1a: Frank: Yw! There is no right or wrong way to trade, per se, but you have to have the right foundation and then you can develop your own style.
14:27 Shaun11: Can Some one suggest on where  to find a ThinkScript professionals to create custom script for me.
14:28 John1a: Frank: There is a reason why they're called Bids and Offers, Bid/Ask, the market is an auction, so you have to learn how an auction process works and why the price moves in a first place. Once you get that, the rest are just details.
14:29 MTS1: Shaun; the good ones are here; post your request and see what happens. Likely you'll be pointed at resources to help you learn so you can do this yourself.
14:30 Joebone87: hey guys.. am i just missing it or can i scan based on div yeild? i thought for sure that was a default scan?
14:31 Joebone87: whoops
14:31 Joebone87: found it
14:31 Joebone87: how did i miss that
14:33 AJayKC: movingavgcrossover ("l1" = 50, "l2" = 200) is true.
14:33 AJayKC: sorry i got disconnected
14:34 John1a: Frank: It is just like Ebay only here they sell  the price of some stock or futures. It really does not matter, used books or ES, the basics of an auction process are the same.
14:36 FrankB3:     thanks, John,  will follow up
14:36 Shaun11: Hello MTS1: here is what I'm looing for.                                                   I would like to create an alert  as soon as  the price is greater than Upper bowlinger band( length 9, exponential) on the current bar. This is for a FOREX pair (eg:EUR/USD) on 15 minute chart.
and second condition: the bar length(the difference of low and high) is greater than 10 pips.
14:36 MTS1: Ajay; did you see my responses above?
14:37 John1a: yw
14:37 MTS1: What type of alert Shaun; on a chart, or email / SMS (which would mean marketwatch alert).
14:38 mthfr_vaxxed: Ajay:
14:38 mthfr_vaxxed: 
input length1 = 50;
input length2 = 200;
input percent = 10;
input averageType1 = AverageType.Simple;
input averageType2 = AverageType.Simple;
input crossingType = {default above, below};
def avg1 = MovingAverage(averageType1, price, length1);
def avg2 = MovingAverage(averageType2, price, length2);
plot signal = crosses(avg1 * 1 + (percent/100), avg2, crossingType == CrossingType.above);
14:38 Shaun11: Alert I mean an alarm( sound wave)
14:38 mthfr_vaxxed: delete the useless inputs or fix the code
14:39 AJayKC: thanks mts1 sorry i was having connection issue. i had to close the chatroom and open again.
14:39 AJayKC: i'll try that.
14:40 AJayKC: also thank you mthfr for that code. i'll sure try that code also. i appreciate.
14:40 AJayKC: sorry if u felt like i just asked the question and dissapeared.
14:41 mthfr_vaxxed: i dont feel
14:41 mthfr_vaxxed: jk
14:44 amalia: We are Vulcans/Borg
14:46 MTS1: Shaun; the bollingerbandscrossover is a built-in study which you can use for either. The chart alert sounds are limited to some pre-defined dings. The MW sound alerts may be customizable IIRC. For MW alerts you can built one in the alert builder; go to Marketwatch - Alerts, put in your pair,  select 'Study Alert', and in the condition builder specify Price, Crosses, and select the BB study and set your criteria . For Chart Alerts you'll have to copy the built-in script, give it a name, and add a line like : Alert(signal, "Cross Abpve BB", BAR, Sound.Chimes);
14:48 MTS1: Sounds lik you may be new to the platform; I'd contact support and have them schedule a platform tour; have 10 questions / features ready that you want to know more about to ask them & guide the tour.
14:54 MTS1: PS; a MW alert will run in the background, even if you don't have chart open. The Chart Study can be added to your chart without alerts if you build in MW and it will plot arrows where alerts should have gone off.
15:00 Shaun11: MTS1. Thanks you. I have tried the Bowlingband Crossover on the study alert  . it is selecting the bars which are closed above/below BB. I'm looking to identify the bars that are just crossed/closed.      condition below.....                                                                                                                 BollingerBandsCrossover("length" = 9, "band" = "lower", "crossing type" = "below", "average type" = "EXPONENTIAL") is true
15:00 toad1144: Can someone help me with this script i am getting an error on the plot line and dont know why
15:01 toad1144: declare lower;
MoneyFlowmultiplier = (close - open) / (high - low);
MoneyFlowVolume = MoneyFlowMultiplier * volume;
plot moneyFlowVolume = (previous period moneyflowvolume + current moneyflowvolume;
moneyflowVolume.SetDefaultColor(GetColor(1));
15:05 toad1144: hello??
15:07 Farmin: you can't make up your own syntax
15:07 Farmin: have yu read the thinkScript tutorials?
15:07 toad1144: yes
15:08 Farmin: then what illegal syntax do you have in the code above?
15:09 toad1144: its the previous period and current period but i cant find the correct syntax for those two
15:10 Farmin: read up on referencing historical data
15:10 toad1144: k thanks
15:19 MTS1: Shaun; not clear on what it is your're looking for that you're not getting from the indicator. Are you saying you want prior bar to have closed above? Thought you were saying current bar crossing above.
15:20 MTS1: Toad; it's chapter 10 of the TS tutorials iirc.
15:21 Joebone87: toad..  gotta read the tutorial.. but something to think about is that everything in TOS has to have a object name associated with it
15:21 Shaun11: Current bar which crossed the BB
15:21 Joebone87: so you plot moneyflow
15:22 Joebone87: to plot something name it first then give it a value
plot NAME_OF_IT = whatever your ploting
15:23 Shaun11: Bowlingband Crossover study results only the the bars that are price closed and crossed BB
15:24 monaghai: My chart is not refreshing. what should i do?
15:24 MTS1: price closed = you mean prior bars that closed above?
15:24 MTS1: ^Shaun
15:24 MTS1: Mona; restart tos or call support
15:24 monaghai: I did hat
15:24 monaghai: that
15:24 monaghai: even restarted system
15:24 Shaun11: I'm looking for the current bar, which crosses BB
15:25 bob: time on all charts ends at 14:42 ... frozen. tried reset to defaults. turn off and on any suggestions?
15:27 MTS1: And support was not able to help you Monag?
15:27 bob: fixed itself - good night
15:27 MTS1: I'll look at the script Shaun, but assumed it was doing that.
15:27 Joebone87: Hey AI.. or MT or anyone really.. 
if you were going to hold a portfolio of 10 ish names with highish div yeild.. avg of 3.75 - 4.2..  there are 300+ names to pick from in this list.
http://tos.mx/tfGIRj#
if you were going to model a portfolio and hold 10 of these names on technical and maybe the limited fundamental stats we have in thinkscript.  how would you do it.
I was thinking something as limited as roll positions on a quarterly basis and roll into whatever did best on a rolling 6month and 3month averaged average?
any experience advice jumping into something like this?
15:28 monaghai: thanks It worked
15:29 Joebone87: thanks in advance for any input.. ill share if it turns into anything worth sharing
15:31 Ky: K
15:33 MTS1: Shaun; have you tried it live? A chart is updated live; as a bar crosses above BB it should signal, but if it crosses back and closes below the (historical) arow plot will go away. But an alert would have gone off as it crossed the first time on that bar.
15:35 MTS1: No custom script would be able to do this differently as you'd have to use the same function.
15:35 MTS1: Only option then would be to go use a lower timeframe and change the BB plots / alerts to imitate  the higher aggregation. 
15:39 MTS1: Joe; probably more for AI or JQ. But what is your goal, and what's more important? (Highest div possible vs total capital appriciation incl dividends so lower risk of price declines? Etc).
15:41 Vimes: Joe, if you are sticking just to the technical side, one option you can try is a momentum strategy of the best performing stocks over your lookback period
15:44 Shaun11: MTS1:I'm looking exactly a you mentioned ."           as a bar crosses above BB it should signal, but if it crosses back and closes below the (historical) arow plot will go away. But an alert would have gone off as it crossed the first time on that bar.
15:45 Shaun11: Currently the market is very slow to make a move above BB. I'll tet and let you know
15:47 Shaun11: MTS1 : Any suggestion on the second condition : when the bar length(the difference of low and high) is greater than 10 pips.
15:48 Shaun11: for Forex price
15:52 MTS1: Did not see that before. Not familiar with Forex / Pips; but should be easy to add in; need to add something to the signal condition like "AND high-low>10"; just not sure if 10 would be 10 pips in this case, or if you use 100 or something else instead of 10.
15:53 amalia: (High-Low)>=(TickSize()*10) is my guess
15:53 MTS1: bbib
16:04 bigworm: so today was like just joking kind of day
16:04 bigworm: in /es
16:04 bigworm: short cover
16:08 FrankB3: Does Trader_TV freeze your whole computer,, lately ????
16:08 OpInfantry: Would anyone be able to help me with the MACD crossover centerline scan?
16:09 OpInfantry: I want to run a scan for whent the AVG crosses either above or below the centerline.
16:15 MTS1: the center line is just a 20 SMA
16:15 MTS1: so scan for crossing an SMA
16:19 MTS1: Sorry; totally miss-read that in my mind
16:19 amalia: Macd().Avg crosses 0
16:19 amalia: ? idk
16:21 MTS1: You're really looking for the avg (second plot) to cross 0, not the primary MACD plot (value)?
16:21 Shaun11: Amalia , MTS1 thank you. Let me try that condition, see if it works.
16:22 MTS1: In any case; the MACD obviously is a built-in study; you can build that condition in the scan condition builder.
16:22 MTS1: *Condition Wizard
16:31 MTS1: Guess we lost the infantry;)
16:32 amalia: Guess so
16:32 amalia: Trader Lounge has an interesting convo though. Lady lost 500k or something like that.
16:34 MTS1: But she had low margin interest and low commissions. . .
16:39 Vimes: that's hard to believe, but if true, man feel really bad for her
16:40 Shaun11: Amalia., MTS1 : I tried the following in a 2 minute FOREX chart.but not triggering,       (High-Low)>=(TickSize()*1) True.
16:41 amalia: Not what I had suggested. Scroll up and compare
16:43 MTS1: I don't really Vimes; I mean I'm sorry for her, but she made her bed. Got advice this AM and still ignored it. She herself stated she has a gabling issue. Not sure why a gambler would go in all-in with all their possessions on one color on the roulette table; but guess she put it on one stock. Not sure how leverage played into this; she's not clear. Lot's of traders started as gambling and had to lose it to start paying attention and learn first; she may be great down the road;)
16:44 MTS1: Shaun; that does not look like a chart script; do you have a plot or something?
16:44 MTS1: Thought it was in combination with the BB crossover?
16:45 MTS1: Where in TOS are you trying to use this; are you biulding a script in charts with a plot / arrows etc, or are you building an alert in MarketWatch, or something else?
16:45 Shaun11: MTS1 First I wanted to test the bar lenght alone, if that works. I have that script in the sturdy alert
16:46 MTS1: OK; so you have a standalone script? What is the rest of hte script?
16:47 amalia: Share the script.
16:47 MTS1: Best way to test even an alert script is to put it on a chart; move it to a lower panel, and if it's a boolean condition plot you'll see the spikes when the condition was true and an alert was triggered.
16:49 MTS1: A script on a chart has to have a ";" at the end of a line, and needss a plot. So in  your case it might be: plot signal = (High-Low)>=TickSize(); which would always be true and should plot a horizontal line at 1, or ticksize * 10 for your original condition, and you'll see spikes when it would have triggered. .  
16:49 MTS1: gtg bbl
16:51 Shaun11: from market watch I have slected a forex pair with 2 minute. then selected Stud Alert. I have added condition with as (High-Low)>=(TickSize()*1), selected trigger if : True. on the set Alert Rules, I have checked reverse cross over and Bell Sound alert. then create Alert
16:52 MTS1: it never reverse crosses as it is always true like that; follow my suggestion and try it on a chart.
17:00 Shaun11: MTS1: are you suggesting me to create a study with code: plot signal = (High-Low)>=TickSize()*10 and then add that study on the chart?
17:13 neo_theone: #
# Shaun click the beaker icon and press create
# a window will open paste this code in it
# on the bottom right click OK button
# click another OK button in the beaker icon or studies window
# your study is now added to the chart
# BTW the study seems to have little value, it will trigger a lot and will also trigger at the most inopportune moments. you might want to rethink your study
plot signal = (High-Low)>=TickSize()*10 ;
def up = crosses (High-Low, TickSize()*10, crossingDirection.ABOVE) ;
AddVerticalLine(up, "up "+round(close,2), color.GREEN, curve.POINTS);
Alert(up, "up "+round(close,2), alert.BAR, Sound.BELL);

17:34 Shaun11: thank you Amalia. let me try
17:38 Shaun11:    Hello Neo. I tried your code. I see just a line 
17:39 MTS1: drag it lower panel
17:40 MTS1: it toggles between 0&1, false & true
17:41 mcdon0301: hey so. it's a tall request because the product is considered hocus pocus. I can't seem to finish it. anyone interested in seeing the solar system?    http://tos.mx/AU4i0G#
17:42 mcdon0301: it's not a simple script, but interesting none the less
17:45 mcdon0301: the calcuations into the remaining planets are far different
17:45 Shaun11: MTS1, drag it lower panel ??. sorry. Im new.
17:46 amalia: Shaun11, have you gone through a platform tour?
17:51 Shaun11: yes Amelia.
17:53 amalia: I would schedule another through support@thinkorswim.com and before the tour, write down 10+ questions/inquiries to ask about.
17:53 Shaun11: MTS1. I dont see 0&1 on my chart. any way Can we change the script to provideonly sound  sound alert, when bar lenght is greate than 10 pips.
17:54 amalia: Alert((High-Low)>(TickSize()*10));
17:54 amalia: disclaimer: coding in chat. might get errors
17:54 amalia: Shaun11, which ticker/symbol do you mostly trade or want this alert?
17:55 Shaun11: forex pair EUR/USD
17:56 amalia: Thanks mcdon0301. Intersting study.
17:59 mcdon0301: no problem. not sure it's useful , though.
18:01 amalia: Why do you have it the study?
18:04 amalia: Shaun11, what timeframe are you looking at?
18:06 Shaun11: Amalia :actually I needed on 15 min when the bar length is great than 10 pips but for testing I'm using the study on 2 min with TickSize()*2
18:06 amalia: huh
18:06 amalia: Ok, before we begin this rabbit hole. HOW exactly does this make you money?
18:07 mcdon0301: my interest in harmonics lead me to L. Pesavento. he asserts some interesting facts about the affects of planet positions on people. His main point was quite logical - the main cycle is our solar system. just interested and had time so..
18:10 amalia: Read The Delta Phenomenon by Welles Wilder
18:11 neo_theone: hi otto long time no see how is everything
18:11 mcdon0301: according to LP, it isn't a timing tool. more just dates to be cognizant of.  most likely a load stuff
18:13 mcdon0301: thanks. i will read it.
18:13 MTS1: Shaun, if you add a line to the script it will be added on the lower panel when you add it to your chart: declare lower;
18:14 MTS1: or you can drag it in the window where you edit the scripts on your chart
18:14 mcdon0301: whats your useful takeaway from the book?
18:16 otto2000: hi neo... was in canada for a while... cold... cold... cold... back in CA now
18:16 otto2000: still working on my script...
18:16 otto2000: 5 years now
18:16 MTS1: McDon; so you didn't ask alpha?
18:17 neo_theone: sope you had fun. CA is much nicer
18:17 neo_theone: hope
18:17 otto2000: it is nice there, too.... only colder
18:18 neo_theone: yes but i am allergic to cold
18:18 neo_theone: your script is very good
18:18 neo_theone: you will finish it
18:19 mcdon0301: i see. amalia. well try this. divide saturn's longdeg by 24 then use it as a rotating length for any average. Even though correlation isn't causation, it is a little crazy when you test correlation.
18:19 amalia: Didn't get much of it other than a moon phase script http://tos.mx/VAnFaX#
18:19 otto2000: gdetting closer to pulling the trigger with /YM
18:19 neo_theone: thats awesome otto
18:19 amalia: 783 buysignal, otto.
18:20 mcdon0301: thanks!!
18:20 otto2000: thanks amalia... I am trying to create long/short signals
18:20 neo_theone: amalia dont you think that moon phases and planets use is hocus pocus [even around halloween]
18:21 otto2000: neo: of course...
18:21 amalia: Correlation isn't causation neo
18:21 neo_theone: lol yes
18:23 mcdon0301: amalia, was that the same script you shared last night?
18:24 mcdon0301: i'm around stats guys all day. can't help it :/
18:25 amalia: No.
18:27 mcdon0301: just making sure i'm somewhat sane still
18:47 amalia: lol
18:54 Vimes: yeah cause this is the sane group
18:55 amalia: It is. You should try some of the other rooms. We maintain ourselves here if you see what's in the other rooms.
18:55 amalia: For a while, we would be the only room open afterhours until people started noticing then using it as the RomperRoom afterdark. Room hours changed shortly after that.
18:56 Shaun11: neo: I can see that your code logic working fine with 0&1 for true and false. but the sound.bell alert seems not working.                                                                                     plot signal = (High-Low)>=TickSize()*10 ;
#AddVerticalLine(up, "up "+round(close,2), color.GREEN, curve.POINTS);
18:56 Vimes: yep the trader lounge is a bit of a zoo
18:58 Shaun11: neo:Also is it possible to change the 0&1 to an arrow on top of the bar, when it is true
19:14 alx: Hello, Is it possible to calcualte yesterdays aftermarket volume?
19:14 alx: in a TOS script
19:47 admin_tculs: thinkScript Lounge chatroom will be closing soon   Please finish all conversations by 8pm ct  Have a nice evening
19:57 John1a: mcdon0301: Do you have a script that does this Saturn thingy? I've read a study some time ago about a correlation with the Moon phases. Wasn't yesterday a full moon? Full moon should be bullish, new moon bearish, we did get a rally this time, but would be interesting to backtest it.
