15:46 Grasul: minus the commenting of course, I can't firgure out why ReferenceHigh doesn't ever seem to have a value
15:46 Grasul: if I plot ReferenceHigh I get nothing
15:47 JohnnyQuotron: But if you are like me and you look at Gaussian RSI Laguerre as the primary indicator but TMO and Gaussian SMA Crossovers then having a little quick and dirty profit calc on each lower study is reassuring.
15:56 Nube: grasul, make your reference high tow variables. The first being the high at the ll and the next being for highs above that. Doing that will let you see where the problem is.
15:56 Grasul: ok, thank you
15:58 JohnnyQuotron: trying to self-assign a non initialized rec...   do you have a little ! on your chart?
16:01 JohnnyQuotron: grasul.. please post the fix as I need to learn how to fix that error as well
16:09 Grasul: will do
16:30 amalia: Look at Renko study for example
16:41 MTS1: JQ; I think you can click on the ! to figure out the cause.
16:46 Grasul: I figured out my issue. The line that read def ReferenceHigh = if NewLow == 1 then 0 else if high > "ReferenceHigh" then high else ReferenceHigh[1];
16:47 Grasul: The ReferenceHigh in quotes needs to be ReferenceHigh[1], it can't test against itself, it needs to test against the previous bar
16:48 MTS1: makes sense; good feeling you found it right?
16:49 Grasul: I don't know about you guys, I consider myself pretty decent at logic chains, but in my coding, its almost always a logic issue
16:50 Grasul: (once you know the basic syntax)
16:50 Grasul: squishing bugs is always a good feeling past the initital frustration
16:50 MTS1: so it is for trading, plus human psycology..
16:51 MTS1: In scripting helps to know how to debug to see the values you're working with. Or breaking down statemetns smaller to see if the final statement is correct logic.
16:52 Grasul: yah, I code for at least part of my job for a living (though SQL, not this) so I get lots of practice squishing bugs.  The human part of trading, testing against yourself and figuring what makes yourself tick are for sure the interesting and challenging part.
16:54 Grasul: in this language, you do so much of the work in the variable definition, I think I'm just going to start by plotting almost all of my variables as I write the code and then remove the variable plots I don't care about once I'm sure they're getting the right answers.  It seems like the best way to debug.
16:56 MTS1: That probably gets cumbersome once you're somewhat familiar with the syntax, plus you cannot plot recursive variables that reference themselves. But yes that is the right way to debug; if there are many variables I'll debug a section at a time though. (and add plot statements for recursive variables that can easily be commented out again).
16:57 Grasul: that makes sense, I appreciate the help

18:42 UpTheCreek: guess that's what you call a simple script  ;)
18:51 cajun: Vimes, thankyou for post... interesting measures in there, like minimum negative excursion on winning trades.  i looked back at the july buffer you referenced, i see only few comments on gaps. 
18:51 cajun: could you say more about it
18:55 Vimes: That is the distance the bar went away from the target.  I can't see inside the 30min bar for example to say which occurs first but assumes you would have to sit through potentially that excusion to get the risk off on the target retracement level, it maybe gives some calibration for the amount of risk tolerance you would have to give
18:59 Vimes: to do something more precise we would have to build a shorter time frame study, say 5min cancles, and analyze the actual intraday bars, i wanted to avoid that so went with something that is more of a guide
19:04 cajun: yep... a conservative eastimate.. sounds like then a worst case estimate?... since youre using the full length of the excursion .   and that means " avg win"  is a conservative underestimate of the same propirtion? 
19:06 Vimes: yes that is only the amount of positive expectancy on each ladder doesn't not net out a stop loss or whatever
19:09 cajun: im awed by the systematized step by step calculations .. will take me alot more code learning to fully understand.   seems like the math should be useful for extracting to other estimates.  nice work
19:15 Vimes: well thanks, not a coder, but can fake it every now and then
19:19 cajun: ha!
19:19 cajun: g.n. folks! all sweet dreams
19:21 Brad952: gn
19:22 MTS1: thanks TCuls!
19:23 Nube: Nice work, Vimes!
19:23 Vimes: ty
19:25 Vimes: Some typical observations on gap fills, i usually when you start to retrace to certain levels the probabiliy improves that you will close the full gap, this is similar to background on pivot points as well, this doesn't mean price has to do anything but just to be aware that once gaps start to retrace, there is positive expactancy that they will continue, so combined with other indicators can give some good trades, some also look at market internals at the open, tick, volume etc. to further screen gap fills
19:25 MTS1: a little long to read on my phone;) will check it out though, thanks for sharing!
19:26 slashgw: here is another study for gap fills if you have interest to check it out.  I did not write it.  it is from BigWaveDave http://tos.mx/uJmNWN#
19:27 MTS1: if it does not retrace though Vimes, higher possibility of a trend day for example
19:29 slashgw: it can be a trend day, till it turns and fills the gap ;)
19:30 MTS1: trend days oscillators don't work well & you should just get in when it pulls back to ma or trend line
19:31 slashgw: gap fill level is often a good entry location after it fills
19:32 slashgw: even if not on the same day
19:33 Vimes: Yes there are some theories that all gaps eventually fill with some high probability, but i have no data on that
19:33 slashgw: https://screencast.com/t/JfV5FBouM
19:34 slashgw: and the next one to look at on ES should be in the 2753 area
19:35 MTS1: I can see it's a natural SR level cuz people wish they bought at that point, jumping in when it gets back to that level
19:35 MTS1: *SR area
19:36 slashgw: https://screencast.com/t/3YqKK7TleIdJ
19:37 slashgw: well, imo, it's because of not getting left behind.
19:37 Vimes: that's the study you shared last week?
19:37 Vimes: or so
19:38 slashgw: the one in screencast  just showing the horizontal purple lines, yes.
19:39 slashgw: http://tos.mx/fubvrS#
19:40 Vimes: thx
19:42 G3_: nice charting slashgw
19:43 slashgw: with regard to ES, any gap greater than 10 points in either direction is considered a "pro gap & go", so odds are obviously much less to immediately fill.  then tend to just keep trading away, but when a trading setup does break, then typically the gap level will become the target.  But within that 10 point or less gap, odds of gapfill can be quite good.  as always, anything is possible though.
19:43 slashgw: thanks G3
19:46 Vimes: There was a trade setup proposed by noble, that related to overnight trade that exceeded the maintenance margin, the idea if the gap was that large folks woudl immediately cover causing a short burst of trade continuing
19:46 slashgw: ah, interesting theory.  thanks.
19:48 Ariana3: I've heard about a maintenance margin strategy before. Sounds interesting, do you guys have a strategy or an indicator for it?
19:49 G3_: a 10 point + gap?
19:50 G3_: seems it would have to be +15 to rattle thoses cages.
19:51 Ariana3: Yes, by Noble in a book The Trader's Edge, that is where I've read it.
19:51 Vimes: you would have to look at the contract specs, i think its something like 22 points on nq
19:51 Vimes: ^arana correct
19:51 G3_: I was referring to /es
19:51 Nube: 5000 worth of gap seems like it might be enough to spook margins and blow through a ot of stops so I can believe that
19:52 Nube: Traders are concerned, price continues because of covering and they bail out. Can see it.
19:52 Nube: arithmetic was never my strong suit
19:53 Nube: or reading or writing
19:53 slashgw: yeah, can def see it.  just never thought about it from that perspective.  always looked at it from a FOMO perspective.
19:53 slashgw: napping is my strong suit
19:53 slashgw: oh, and recess
19:54 Nube: Now we gotta make an overnight margin trouble script
19:54 slashgw: that could become an important one soon :)
19:55 Ariana3: He calls it "the Initial-Maintenance Opening Rule"
19:56 Vimes: i can't find my book, so don't recall the full details
19:56 Vimes: i think its the delta between the initial and maintenacne margin
19:56 Vimes: which maybe could vary by futures broker
19:56 Ariana3: I have it, hold on
19:57 G3_: when and if margin req are raised.  They are sure as hell not going to be lowered anytime soon. fwiw
19:58 Vimes: i recall the language in teh book being kind of murky, it was a bit dated

08:02 tarbog: hello, i have a simple script to draw the days mid point that just shows a horizontal line that move as new highs and lows are made.� how would i add a time factor to it to make it more like the vwap or a moving average that would track the mid point of the day to that time and leave that plot there and adjust through out the day so you could see where the mid point of the day was at any time of the day.    
08:08 Mobius: get the barNumber() at time and hold that value as the plot
08:12 Mobius: Example:

def time = if SecondsTillTime(0930) == 0
                  then barNumber()
                 else double.nan;
def price = if !isNaN(time)
                   then hl2
                  else price[1];
plot lineAtTime = if barNumber() >= HighestAll(time)
                              then highestAll(if isNaN(close[-1])
                                                        then price
                                                        else double.nan)
                             else double.nan;
08:13 Mobius: For more examples go to Mobius on MyTrade
08:13 chief: There is a built in study HighLowMA that may work for you also
08:13 chief: Midle high low MA
08:15 Mobius: +1% Globex range with avg volume. Should be a good trading range today.
08:16 Mobius: BTW -  Good morning all
08:16 UpTheCreek: GM
08:16 DMonkey: morning....
