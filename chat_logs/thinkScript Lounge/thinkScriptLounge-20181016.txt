13:02 Nube: bk, how hard would it be to delete the minus sign and try it.
13:03 bkstrader: Just did Nube no luck
13:03 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current.
13:05 JohnnyQuotron: Question.. has anyone scripted a scan for the Gaussian Self Adjusting RSI Laguerre with FE?  I will try if not.
13:09 JohnnyQuotron: bks.  trouble shoot.. try a bubble with just the adx...  then try another with just the other variable data one by one  create debug labels for each bit of variable data you want in the bubble.  
13:09 Nube: bk, did you use the incorrect syntax that is in the post at :03?
13:09 JohnnyQuotron: Is the bubble in the proper xy location?
13:10 anees: hello , is there a way to get the floor pivot points, i get the pre programmed pivots and they arent accurate thanks
13:10 Nube: If you use the correct syntax and index the y value back the same distance you index the x value, you will have data
13:10 JohnnyQuotron: anees check mobius my trade or the community one note
13:11 anees: where is that

13:13 bkstrader: Thanks JohnnyQ, That's where I'm headed The bubble is in the right location. I was hoping with the skills in this room there might be quick. Time to roll up the sleeves tonight
13:13 bkstrader: Nube That gives me anothe direction to try
13:14 JohnnyQuotron: debug the variables one at a time in the bubble. Trust Nube
13:14 bkstrader: JQ I know , Nube has helped may times in the past
13:15 anees: i dont get what i am supposed to do here
13:15 anees: but thank you
13:15 JohnnyQuotron: anees
13:15 JohnnyQuotron: which method
13:15 JohnnyQuotron: which source
13:16 anees: i dont know all i know its called floor pivot points , i saw they were pretty accurate and wanted to ask if they are available for tos because i already have them on DAS
13:17 JohnnyQuotron: are you in the onenote?
13:17 JohnnyQuotron: are you in mobius mytrade?
13:17 anees: yeah
13:18 JohnnyQuotron: which
13:18 anees: one note
13:19 JohnnyQuotron: support resistance section?
13:19 anees: ok
13:20 anees: oh i see them
13:20 JohnnyQuotron: 2. Pivot Scripts... there are 30 of them  Floor Trader Pivots may be a place to start
13:21 anees: yeah im gonna try all of them
13:21 anees: thank you so much
13:21 JohnGalt82: Hi - Wondering if this is built in TOS or has been shared.  Looking to plot swing lines that cross back and forth over a moving average
13:21 JohnnyQuotron: that's what its there for.  Hope you find what ou want. :)
13:22 anees: thanbks johnny appreciate it pal
13:22 JohnnyQuotron: may the code be with you...
13:30 sugar: does anyone know how to use the scan for donchian? I want to scan the ATRSX with close? or send me a copy of the scan.
13:33 JohnnyQuotron: sugar..chart strategy Donchian_Channel DOWNtrend: http://tos.mx/chn8QV# 
chart strategy Donchian_Channel UPtrend: http://tos.mx/ZR7BfU# 
13:33 JohnnyQuotron: scan section of the onenote..search for donchian
13:34 sugar: johnnyquotron: it states the URL is broken for both
13:34 JohnnyQuotron: oops my mistake.. those are strategies.. duh
13:34 sugar: johnnyquotron: it's ok you are already helping me out- so ithere a way?
13:35 Mobius: Johnny - There's an RSI Laguerre in MyTrade. The Gaussian version won't scan - Too Complex
13:35 Mobius: RSI Laguerre Scan in MyTrade
13:35 sugar: Mobius: can you send me the RSI Laguerre scan?
13:36 Mobius: no go get it from MyTrade
13:36 sugar: Mobius: where do you get mytrade?
13:37 sugar: Mobius: is that in think & swim?
13:37 Mobius: Right click ANY uers name and go the profile.
13:37 JohnnyQuotron: Mobius.. yes i have that and use it.  But with many etfs and S&P500 stocks i find the gaussian keeps me in the trade longer.    I'm a huge fan. Wonder if it will scan without the FE component?
13:37 Mobius: nope Johnny it will not
13:41 sugar: Mobius & Johnnyquontron: can I run a scan with donchain (ATRSX) with close?
13:43 JohnnyQuotron: mobius... bummer bummer bummer
13:47 Mobius: Johnny - This will scan.
Something in the scanner has changed since I wrote the original. It wouldn't scan then but I just checked and doesn now.

13:48 Mobius: The scan  reference was to the Study name and main plot crossing 0
13:48 Mobius: 8 returns on the S&P 500
13:49 Mobius: Well that would make a couple thousand TOS traders happy to know.
13:53 JohnnyQs_BackupWks: YOU THE MAN !
13:57 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current.  Thank you Mobius and thank you ToS for updating those scan servers. Wahoo...
13:58 bsinks: This has most likely been asked a bazillion times and if so I'm sorry..........Does any body have a link for a good HOD MOMO scanner for TOS
13:58 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - last time that was shared, it had Nfe of 8, Glenght of 13, BetaDev of 4. Now it is configured 5, 13, 8.
Any specific reason for the change. Symbol used on? aggregation period?
14:02 Mobius: Alpha... Just the way I used it last is all
14:02 chief: sugar, this should work as Donchian buy scan....
input length = 50;
plot buy = high > Highest(high[1], length);
14:04 AlphaInvestor: Thanks mobius - the shape and crossing times change of course - I think this is agreat study, one of the best you have done ... so always interested in how/why it works the way it does.
P.S. the math is beyond me
14:07 Mobius: Alpha.. The latest one I've been working on uses an error correction neuron to set the length for the gaussian filter and RSI time factor. Pretty cool.
14:07 AlphaInvestor: oooh, super cool
14:08 AlphaInvestor: I am short a few physical neurons, so software ones are always beneficial
14:08 Mobius: I'll post it when I'm sure it's working correctly
14:08 AlphaInvestor: Great, thanks!
14:08 AlphaInvestor: If yoiu need beta testers ...
14:08 Mobius: I'm sure the group will have a ball twisting and morphing it :)
14:09 bigworm: neuron?
14:09 AlphaInvestor: I rarely touch your studies, except to change the lipstick, or add debug statement so that I can understand how they work
14:10 Mobius: lol  go back to sleep big... 
14:10 ramesh2599: Is it possible to displaly dynamic vertical line  50 bars back?
14:10 AlphaInvestor: yes
14:11 AlphaInvestor: why, would be an appropriate question tho
14:12 MTS1: Ramesh; use barnumber() function and do the math to determine where 50 bars back is. Or index like IsNan(close)[-50]
14:13 Mobius: Quite a bit of /ES volume swapping hands today with no real movement.
14:13 ramesh2599: I am looking into its relationship with  RSI
14:13 Mobius: let me save you some time - There is no relationship with current RSI and RSI 50 bars back
14:14 MTS1: Ramesh; which relationship with RSI?
14:14 ramesh2599: ok
14:15 Mobius: Other than the Butterfly Effect
14:15 MTS1: But 48 bars may work;)
14:15 ramesh2599: 49 to be exact!
14:15 ramesh2599: Thank you all though!!
14:16 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - that is too simplistic - they will both be between 0 and 100
14:16 bigworm: lol i wasnt sleeping.  been up since 6!! had class today to learn about the kernel trick!!!
14:17 bigworm: seems very useful.  I have been looking at code on classifiers and it seems there are alot of ones that are iterative and you need lots of loops.  with kernels, it appears you only need to go over it once
14:17 bigworm: so computationaly, it appears much more effiecient and easy to swap out
14:17 Mobius: You turned left on your way to Walmart last night and because you didn't turn right an accident happened in Russia that killed the one person that could have saved the planet 40 years from now. But the one person that would save the planet 39 years from now was born because if the same turn you made last night.  True Story. 
14:18 bigworm: lol what?
14:19 Vimes: JD?
14:20 Vimes: i thinke he's illustrating the butterfly effect
14:20 bigworm: great movie
14:22 Mobius: String Theory, Chaos Theory, Quantum Entanglement - Spooky Action at a Distance, whatever everything is connected
14:22 bigworm: agree
14:24 Vimes: is it simlar to the kevin bacon theory
14:24 bigworm: mmm
14:24 AlphaInvestor: I know a guy named Kevin, and I like bacon
14:24 Mobius: ohhh bacon...yum
14:26 Mobius: Did you guys read about the kid that just proved that quantum computers are actually doing quantum stuff?
14:26 AlphaInvestor: bacon infused jack daniels - its a thng ... look it up
14:26 Vimes: i've had bacon in bloody mary's , <-_ not ashamed
14:27 bigworm: whats going on with your brain right now
14:27 Mobius: hmm a breakfast idea
14:27 bigworm: quantum bacon stuff?
14:27 mthfr_vaxxed: urmila mahadev?
14:27 Mobius: yep   grad student
14:27 bigworm: lol
14:27 Mobius: smart girl
14:27 Mobius: she will make a difference
14:28 Mobius: TOS needs to hire her  :)
14:28 bigworm: when will they be out?
14:28 bigworm: probably will be too expensive for me
14:29 Mobius: First Quantum Trading Platform.. You guys paying attention
14:29 Vimes: i think i'm in love
14:29 bigworm: im not quick enough to even use a regular computer that efficiently
14:30 AlphaInvestor: I am stuck on a continuous surface with only one side and only one boundary .. I have no time for such banal persuits
14:31 Mobius: I loved one of the illustrations used to describe a core problem with understanding what a quantum computer is doing. One with 100 qbits held in a single state would take a current harddrive the size of the visible universe to hold it's state data.  
14:33 Mobius: How could any human know if that data is correct??
14:34 mthfr_vaxxed: "Mahadev's protocl is unlikely to be implemented in a real quantum computer in the immediate future. For the time being, the protocol requires too much computing power to be practical."
14:34 Mobius: That young woman found a way... That is cool!
14:34 mthfr_vaxxed: sounds like an expensive "trust" function ....
14:35 Mobius: trust isn't an option
14:35 Mobius: Not unless you thing the Terminator would be a nice buddy
14:36 Mobius: think
14:38 NUG: Since TOS changed the futures symbols, I'm wondering if it is possible to use wildcards in thinkscript to compare with the results of the getSymbol() function??
14:38 Mobius: Why wonder. Use Addlabel and find out
14:38 Vimes: terminator 2, i think he was a nice buddy, been a while though
14:39 NUG: For example: current code is if getSymbol() == "/ES:XCME"
14:39 John1a: Does anyone have a script for the Std Channel in TOS that changes the channels color (green, yellow, red) depending on a trend, up, down, neutral. Thank you.
14:39 NUG: can I use if getSymbol() == "/ES*" ?
14:40 AlphaInvestor: Nug - you can use it, but I don't hink it will work any more
14:41 NUG: belly laugh
14:41 NUG: then why use it?
14:41 NUG: wish they'd leave shit alone
14:42 Vimes: i thought it was an exchange thing
14:42 bigworm: when did you stop teaching formally mobius
14:43 NUG: well, then they should code a routine to change the exchange requirements to the old TOS symbols so our code still works
14:50 NUG: Thanks anyway
14:56 AlphaInvestor: Nug - use   /ES:XCME   in your if statement
15:01 rupam: the RTD function for "/vxx18" does not work - any ideas?
15:01 rupam: i.e. RTD("tos.rtd",,"LAST","/VXX18") returns an error
15:02 Up_n_Up: put it on a watchlist and export it and stop futzing with the Excel side
15:02 rupam: hmm
15:03 AlphaInvestor: use      "/VXX18:XCBF"
15:05 rupam: aha! thanks...
15:09 Up_n_Up: watchlist columns that get exported somehow magically have the correct syntax, it's .... increeeedable...
15:09 chief: Never mind grad students and quantum computers. This is the headline that should get more attention  "New research suggests that climate change could trigger a global shortage of beer. " 
15:15 Taurean: Hey could somebody help me with a study as to when the Stochasitc RSI on the 5 minute chart goes above overbought or oversold and the Average line and the Value line are both greater than or less than the previous on the 30 minute chart please
15:18 Mobius: cheif - That is serious
15:20 Mobius: big.. I retired full time teaching 20 years ago. I had a grad student course up until 2 yrs ago and a couple students finishing last year.
15:20 Taurean: Hey Mobius could you give me a hand with my above statement if you dont mind?
15:21 Mobius: Taurean.. For a scan that can be done with the scan wizard easily.
15:21 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - how the heck old are you, are you in your 200's yet?
15:21 Mobius: lol  close
15:21 AlphaInvestor: retired 20 years ago, dats a long time ago
15:22 Mobius: Some of us don't wait till we're 70 to retire you know
15:23 AlphaInvestor: I dream of retiring that early
15:25 MTS1: @180???
15:25 Mobius: Alpha... There's this little thing called trading. Try that and you'll never go to an office again.  :)
15:26 AlphaInvestor: never heard tell of that kinda thing ... how would one learn how to do that?
15:27 Up_n_Up: somebody told me it was hard once
15:28 Mobius: We've traded two inside days since the "Big Red One". How often does that happen and what typically happens next?
15:29 Up_n_Up: sounds like today's pop quiz
15:35 AlphaInvestor: I would bet that the 3rd day after Big Red is not an inside day
15:35 AlphaInvestor: BUT, if I knew the answer, I might just become a trader
15:37 Taurean: Im going to put this on the 5 minute chart...can someone tell me where i went wrong?
15:38 Taurean: StochRSI("rsi length" = 10, "k period" = 10, "slowing period" = 3, "average type" = "EXPONENTIAL")."FullK" crosses below StochRSI("rsi length" = 10, "k period" = 10, "slowing period" = 3, "average type" = "EXPONENTIAL")."OverSold"
MACDTwoLines(aggregationPeriod.THIRTY_MIN)."Value" is greater than MACDTwoLines(aggregationPeriod.THIRTY_MIN)."Value" from 1 bars ago and MACDTwoLines(aggregationPeriod.THIRTY_MIN)."Avg" is greater than MACDTwoLines(aggregationPeriod.THIRTY_MIN)."Avg" from 1 bars ago
15:39 New_Trade: Mobius plese, please open teaching trading room
15:42 AlphaInvestor: Taurean - split that into 2 or more separate conditions, then use
plot Scan = cond1 and cond2 and cond3'
15:42 New_Trade: 2 inside days and VIX = 21.30....
15:42 chief: There is a small pennant on the spy which is usually a continuation pattern. Break to the downside suggests 257 spy
15:43 Nube: I support Mobius having a teaching room but only open by invite to those with the sufficient foundation and desire as determined by the Selection Committee of One.
15:45 AlphaInvestor: Nube - do you chair the SCoO?
15:45 New_Trade: but  scripting is not mandatory...   LOL
15:45 novapawshere: I cant get an alert that occurs when one moving average crosses anohter moving average to work? can someone help me figure out why this may be?
15:45 amalia: 5/29,5/30&5/31 was last InsideBar
15:46 Up_n_Up: ok ,and then what happened?
15:46 amalia: The bottoming happened and we shot up.
15:47 amalia: 4.91% up before we formed a top
15:48 AlphaInvestor: Amalia - i'm game
15:48 Nube: M does.
15:48 novapawshere: anyone willing to hlep?
15:49 AlphaInvestor: Nova - Chart Alert, Marketwatch Alert, or Dynamic Watchlist Alert?
15:49 Nube: Don't get me wrong, I'm glad we don't have that - I'd have never learned to script.
15:49 novapawshere: marketwatch alert
15:49 AlphaInvestor: so for a single symbol
15:50 novapawshere: Like i do if this moving average of 5 periods crosses this moving average of 9 periods alert me. Activates but never alerts when they do cross
15:50 novapawshere: also i do alert if 'true'
15:51 New_Trade: amalia  on 5/29 - 5/31 /ES was above 50 MA and now we below 200 MA
15:52 novapawshere: I feel like it must have something to do with the chart timeframes because  moving averages are different if your looking at a 5m vs 15m but there is no way to select one within alert options as far as i can tell
15:52 slashgw: there should be the option
15:53 novapawshere: where?
15:53 slashgw: when creating the alert
15:53 novapawshere: how confident are you in that?
15:54 slashgw: https://screencast.com/t/R5h1wzt6
15:54 novapawshere: ahh
15:55 novapawshere: i just cant find it in the options though
15:55 novapawshere: wait
15:55 slashgw: https://screencast.com/t/QewgbCq9yeo8
15:55 novapawshere: the live support guy just found it for me
15:55 AlphaInvestor: So, do you have a Study Alert something lke this:
MovingAvgCrossover(length1 = 5, length2 = 9, "crossing type" = "below")
15:55 novapawshere: yeah
15:56 novapawshere: sweet i think that will fix it
15:56 slashgw: cool. goodluck
15:56 novapawshere: thankss slashgw and alphainvester
15:56 novapawshere: you guys rock

16:41 DSF_TX: Could someone help me with a script for a scan .  I want to scan for the 8 ema to be above the 34 ema for 21 days or more.
16:41 DSF_TX: I was able to write the script without the timeframe.  but want to add the 21 day timeframe.
16:42 AlphaInvestor: Combining a Momentum indicator .. and a Choppiness indicator, and looking for where they cross ... hmmm
16:42 AlphaInvestor: share what you have
16:43 FrankB3: Yep,, its called RSI Lagear
16:44 FrankB3:   already been done by Mr. Mo
16:45 AlphaInvestor: Frank - good point

16:47 Vimes: that has about a 50% chance of working
16:48 Nube: The swing from 0 to 1 or visa versa on the LG RSI is fast enough that often it will cross .5 and OB or OS on the same bar so it's likely not a bad cross to take as a signal.
16:48 Nube: Not because the cross itself is special, but the speed makes most crosses about the same
16:49 Donnie: Do they have a screener for the mobile app? Or just the pc
16:50 Vimes: Not sure on the screener part, but i know you can save a screen based watchlist and access it via mobile
16:51 AlphaInvestor: Nube - I configure mine to cross slower ... more of an oscillator, not a yes/no signal
16:51 Nube: Ah, then that would be a different beast
16:52 AlphaInvestor: I know that Mobius likes it to be more of a signal ... because he uses it for program trading
16:53 AlphaInvestor: I prefer the gray area ... when used as an oscillator
16:54 amalia: Donnie, the built in one are pretty good and accessible on mobile. If you prefer a custom one, create one on desktop, save it under a name then you can access the screener on mobile.
16:55 amalia: *ones
17:02 Nube: There's for sure a legitimate reason to want an indication to be an on / off switch. I make my final trade decisions based on a couple of yes or no criteria so it's clear cut. But screening before I get to the yes or no stage is entirely different matter, and one I do not want switch type indicators for.
17:06 TICKZ: Im trying to make a grid to look at the global markets..but I can't find the tickers.. Can Anyone help me plz? or any Ideas?
17:13 chief: tickz...just do a googl search on country etfs
17:14 TICKZ: ok. thanks
17:15 slashgw: also look at cme futures
17:15 TICKZ: like? /6a/6b/6e etc ?
17:15 Nube: Tickz, check out the ishares website. They have ETFs for most counties in the EAFE and the EEM
17:15 slashgw: sure, currencies as well as /NKD and I'm sure there are others
17:16 slashgw: checkout their website to see what all is available
17:16 Nube: ewt, Eden, qat etc etc
17:16 TICKZ: Ok. Thanks guys!
17:25 amalia: Just trade MinRange on /YM.
17:25 mthfr_vaxxed: amalia : did you prepare?
17:26 mthfr_vaxxed: i think your one of the few who listens to my crazy anticts
17:28 amalia: =)
17:30 hguru: How do you scan on the mobile app what am o missing ?
17:32 amalia: I listen to contributors. My leaning towards shortcuts in tS comes from BLT/Mobius, long term books are similar to AlphaInvestor, my daytrading is similar to Mobius’ ORB, my curiosity behind the veil in studies from Nube, etc.
17:33 Nube: Save a scan on desktop and it will be a watchlist on mobile
17:34 hguru: Hum ok I have a bunch of watch lists
17:35 hguru: Your talking scan results becomes a watchlist I get that
17:43 MTS1: Save it as a query and it becomes a 'live' scan / watchlist that updates in mobile.
17:43 MTS1: (Don't just save the output as a watchlist)
17:44 MTS1: Those dynamic watchlists / queries have a pink symbol in front of them on desktop.
17:46 MTS1: (OR green; believe those are option hacker scans)
17:58 hguru: Hum ok thx
18:03 inov: hello..i am writing a simple study alert like below and when I receive the Alert msg, I dont get the text "SimMovAvg_Greater", instead a portion of the code is shown, can one of you help
18:03 inov: def agg = AggregationPeriod.DAY;
plot cPrice = close(period = agg);
plot savg = close > simpleMovingAvg(cPrice,20);
Alert (savg, "SimMovAvg_Greater");
18:08 TICKZ: Nube.. im using your "LABLE" script to add the countrys name.. i change the studie name..but it keeps changing other lables... can you help me plz?
18:09 TICKZ:  
18:10 Up_n_Up: inov, if the syntax is right, contact support and tell them Alert is broken
18:10 TICKZ:  
18:11 Up_n_Up: I guess the obvious question is how did you change it?
18:12 amalia: Buy /YM
18:13 TICKZ: i changed the script name for each country.. thinking it will stp changing other countrys name..
18:14 Up_n_Up: the name of the script has nothing to do with what gets displayed
18:14 Up_n_Up: lounge rule #12 - you can't have your own syntax
18:14 TICKZ:  
18:15 Up_n_Up: that will ALWAYS display Saudi Arabia, no matter what the chart, but then you know that by now
18:15 TICKZ: hah yeah
18:17 Up_n_Up: the one means always display the text string
18:18 slashgw: should be able to take a vote on the syntax one
18:18 TICKZ: I gtg... Thanks
18:18 Up_n_Up: lol slash
18:22 DMonkey: tickz....you will need to use getsymbol() aand use an if then statement....
18:25 Up_n_Up: well not really right  addlbl(getsym()=="whatever", "whatevertxt");
18:26 Up_n_Up: so much fun to make up your own syntax....   :)
18:28 amalia: lol Wish it worked like that.
19:37 John1a: Is there a way to change the color of the columns in the price ladder DOM? I've screen shots with different colors for Bis Size column and other columns, but I cannot find a setting for it. Or is it no longer an option in the current version?
19:45 DMonkey: example....this is one way to accomplish.....you pick your symbols & what you want the text to display.....
addlabel(1,if getsymbol() == "SPY" then "SPY" else if getsymbol() == "XOM" then "Exxon Mobile" else "" + getsymbol());
19:48 admin_tculs: thinkScript Lounge chatroom will be closing soon   Please finish all conversations by 8pm ct   Have a nice evening
19:50 DMonkey: gn
