18:55 MTS1: they'll give you a platform tour for free every 6 months
18:57 daybuck: This would have been much simpler if you could just not respond or admit you dont know how to answer the question
18:58 MTS1: I don't see EarningsPerShareTTM()?
18:59 sebastian2363: Its under the new "stock fundamentals" tab
18:59 MTS1: Oh; not a script?
19:00 sebastian2363: It is a script function
19:01 MTS1: daybuck; really/??? I know the answer, and so should you, we discussed them right in the beginning. It would have been much easier if you just were listening and honest / trying from the start.
19:03 MTS1: It does not seem like you've actually used TOS in the past 5 years and don't know how to add a built-in indicator? Do you know how to add a MA and change the settings? This is not a coding issue, this is PEBKAC.
19:04 amalia: I indulged you for more than a hour. MTS1 also concluded that we've gone full circle but you keep thinking otherwise. Here I am still replying back giving you the benefit of the doubt that you can somehow recover.
19:04 amalia: +1 MTS1
19:06 amalia: btw here are some of your pivots
def MonPivot = HL3(period = AggregationPeriod.MONTH);
def WeekPivot = HL3(period = AggregationPeriod.WEEK);
19:07 MTS1: Sebastian; have not played with those yet, but I'd try some different tickers.
19:07 amalia: daybuck has left the room. lol
19:08 amalia: "No one else can be right" attitude even when asking for help. smh -_-
19:09 sebastian2363: ok. thank you let me try
19:10 amalia: Room, what's a good way to collect Yearly OHLC values?
19:10 MTS1: But my indicator is special; I want it coded from scratch even if it already exists and I don't know what it does;)
19:11 MTS1: Amalia; O/C should be easy based on year change; would you want to use secondary aggregation for H/L or are you trying to keep it scanner friendly?
19:12 MTS1: H/L could be done that way also I guess based on year change; how many years back do you need though?
19:12 MTS1: Amalia; still there??? ;)
19:13 amalia: Yeah, going back and forth from Editor, chart then back here.
19:13 amalia: Funny link but this is what I have so far:
http://tos.mx/SedWed#
19:13 amalia: SedWed. lmao
19:17 MTS1: Not sure why yo have the extra if-then loop in there instead of 
def YearL = if YearChange==1 then L else if L<=YearL[1] then L else  YearL[1] ;
19:18 MTS1: but that's one way. Was thinking you wanted prior year OHLC which you could then carry forward. Or was thinking using monthly aggregation and getting highest, but this is easier.
19:19 amalia: I'm open to ideas really.
19:19 MTS1: (And the close obviously is the prior year's close).
19:19 MTS1: How are you using the values; how far back do you need OHLC, just prior year or current year?
19:20 amalia: This is what I'm trying to calculate:
def yearMinRange = Average(if YearC>=YearO then Min(YearH-YearC,YearO-YearL) else Min(YearH-YearO,YearC-YearL),10);
19:20 amalia: So I can't use Highest/Lowest cause that uses a rolling period
19:24 MTS1: are those current year values?
19:24 amalia: The ones in the label, yes.
19:24 MTS1: no hte yearMinRange def
19:24 MTS1: *the
19:25 amalia: Yes.
19:26 amalia: It's gonna be current until it's BNd I think
19:26 MTS1: Then you've got it already, except use the current close instead of tye Y one as that's last year's close.
19:27 amalia: But I'm trying to get last year's H/L. I can't use current values for calculation
19:27 fibfibfib: hey amalia, I just open your work on the yearly and it looks cool. Just a though, is it possible to include the open and closing price for yearly, monthly, quartley, weekly and daily?
19:27 MTS1: That's what I was asking;)
19:28 amalia: fibfibfib, it looks cool but it's not done yet. Will share when it's done.
19:28 fibfibfib: and on each line, add a bubble to say year open, year close...etc
19:29 MTS1: Then carry forward def PYH = if YearChange==1 then  YearO[1] else PYH[1]; ? 
19:29 MTS1: Sorry PYO in this case - PriorYearOpen; same for H/L
19:29 fibfibfib: thanks Amalia, MTS1.. im just beginning to learn so not as expert as you guys
19:30 fibfibfib: but so far, that's a very good idea to start on.
19:30 MTS1: WE NEED MORE BUBBLE (in SNL CowBell Voice)
19:32 amalia: lol
19:32 MTS1: Is that what you need Amalia, or am I missing something still?
19:33 amalia: Getting off desktop. that useless chat earlier fried my brain. gonna go get my green remedy on to get some cells back to attack this iead head on with more patience. =) MTS1, thanks for indulging
19:34 MTS1: lol, gn
19:34 amalia: =)
19:38 fibfibfib: don't go too long now, we need your brainpower. hahahaha
19:39 fibfibfib: just kidding

06:38 LAZY: hello
06:38 LAZY: anyone there, goodmoring
06:39 LAZY: any hard copy of thinscript manual out there??
06:50 AlphaInvestor: I will print one and mail it to you '-)
06:50 Vimes: name seems right
07:05 LAZY: wow, AlphaInvestor, great.  Can you find my address:
07:11 LAZY: hello AlphaInvestor, I copied thinkscript to word and I will print it myself.  I really appreciate your offer.  keep in touch
07:14 slashgw: lol
07:18 Farmin: Hmmm, if Lazy got together with gofast, would normal result?
07:19 Wally: Copy it to Word and make it useless, funny.
07:20 brutarie: .   Some people understand irony;   others understand ironing.  Hmmm...
07:27 Mobius: lol  Now that's a good start to the day
07:37 eayjee: is anyone able to show me how to make a cloud between 3 moving averages?
07:40 Mobius: addCloud(firstMovingAvg, SecondMovingAvg, FirstColor, SecondColor)
07:41 Mobius: addCloud(SecondMovingAvg, ThirdMovingAvg, FirstColor, SecondColor)
07:41 Mobius: addCloud(firstMovingAvg, ThirdMovingAvg, FirstColor, SecondColor)
07:42 Mobius: two different ways
07:42 eayjee: Mobius, that's awesome, what if I want to base the MA on the high or low or close?
07:43 Mobius: addCloud doesn't care
07:45 eayjee: 26 EMA, 9 period EMA off high, moved 3 periods forward, and the 9 EMA off the low, moved 3 periods forward...
07:46 eayjee: thanks for helping Mobius...red pill
07:46 Mobius: http://tlc.thinkorswim.com/center/reference/thinkScript/Functions/Look---Feel/AddCloud.html
07:46 JohnnyQuotron: Good morning thinkScript Lounge.  I notice that no one has lost their sense of humor.  Excellent!
07:48 Mobius: Got over a 1% globex range on high volume with price near previous close again. Whats NOT to be excited about?
07:53 LAZY: I just copied and printed out thinkscript.  Why Wally siad it is useless in word??
07:54 LAZY: I like to meet gofast :)
07:55 eayjee: mobius, is it hard to put those parameters in a script?  the instruction page wasn't too clear
07:56 eayjee: don't mean to bother and I appreciate any help
07:58 Vimes: not sure you tried very hard: see if this works
def ema26 = expaverage(close,26);
def ema9h = expaverage(high,9)[3];
def ema9l = expaverage(low,9)[3];
addcloud(ema9h,ema26,color.green,color.yellow);
addcloud(ema26,ema9l,color.red,color.yellow);
07:59 eayjee: really appreciate that Vimes, thank you both
08:01 eayjee: that worked perfectly....thanks a lot
08:19 dokk408: anyone know if there's a way to get the implied volatility of an ATM call on the Friday following earnings?
08:20 Mobius: there's no history for series IV
08:21 dokk408: ok, thnx
08:21 Vimes: do you mean the next series?
08:21 Sorkin: Oct 29 GE $12 puts
08:22 dokk408: im trying to track the expansion of IV as earnings approaches
08:22 Vimes: Well mobius read your mind then, no history
08:24 Vimes: You could maybe estimate it from teh ImpVolatility() plot but i'm out of my element there
08:25 tarbog: hey dmonkey.  thanks for the script on day mid.  i got it on my charts yesterday and it worked well for the day session.  thanks.  really appreciate your help.
08:26 dokk408: the ImpVolatility appears to give an aggregation of several expirations
08:44 Mobius: dokk.. There's no need to guess. All the data and method for calculating IV is listed on the CBOE in a white paper.
08:45 BenP: Good Morning.  I have squeezed an intraday chart down so small that I lost the 'Time' displayed in the X axis.  Is there any code available to deliniate the change of each day with a vertical line?
08:46 Mobius: yes
08:47 dokk408: thnx Mobius.  now i just have to learn enough so i can create a script for it so display on my charts!
08:48 Mobius: dokk.. You don't need to learn to calculate it TOS has functions to display annualized IV and all the various series IV already
08:56 willie_sutton: gm all
08:56 BenP: Hi Mobius.  Was that 'yes' for me?
08:59 MTS1: Yes
08:59 MTS1: Look at AddVerticalLine() function
08:59 MTS1: or just put vertical in the left-top filter box in the reference
08:59 MTS1: (to find available functions)
09:02 MTS1: next you'll probably look in the date/time section to find the function to determine if the day changed to use in the vertical line function.
09:04 BenP: gotcha.  thanks !!
09:04 MTS1: yw
09:10 Paris: BenP - Here's an example on plotting a vertical line
# Vertical Line on New Day
# 9.17.2018
def today = getDay() == getLastDay();
addVerticalLine(today and !Today[1], "New Day", color.cyan, curve.short_dash);
09:11 Vimes: i wonder how many total mobius snippets are out there, 1000, 2000?  :) :)
09:12 Paris: I must have at least 500+ snort snippets
09:12 fibfibfib: Hi Mobius, if there a way to automatically fib measure the prior week and month?
09:12 Mobius: fibfib.. yes
09:12 fibfibfib: or does anyone know how?
09:15 Mobius: you already have the Auto Fib Study. Just change the iData to whatever higher aggregation you want
09:17 Paris: whoops, typo: snort = short. LOL!
09:17 willie_sutton: anyone found a way to plot option delta for mulpiple strikes on a lower?
09:18 Vimes: lol, didn't notice
09:18 Mobius: I prefer snort Paris... Fits me better  :)
09:18 Paris: Heh!
09:18 Vimes: a snort of jd
09:20 Mobius: willie.. that could be done as long as you don't try to  get much more than 1 or 2 strikes away from ATM
09:20 willie_sutton: Hi Mobius - that woud be fine with me
09:21 willie_sutton: I hope you're well
09:21 Mobius: then use the Options Dashboard or any of the other studies I've written for a template to get the OPRA symbols. From there you can calculate delta or get it from TOS data
09:22 Mobius: /ES is giving me that sinking feeling
09:23 Vimes: buyers just can't get it done
09:24 Mobius: looks like pros selling into any rally. Volume goes down on a rise and way up on a fall. Energy is on the down side.
09:26 Mobius: Now a days that could change in a minute. Used to be, at the first sign of energy higher going down it was a clear sign to go to a higher cash weighting or to hedge tight. Now it's just not so clearcut.
09:27 Vimes: interesting

09:28 Vimes: i think the chemical market has become so savy on passing on formula pricing based on raws perhaps in the old days they weren't as clver
09:28 Vimes: clever
09:28 mthfr_vaxxed: Any reasons you know of why October is so gloomy usually? Black Thursday from 1929 still scaring everyone? or something else?
09:30 Mobius: mth.. There's 100 opinions about that if there's 1. Best source in my opnion is Traders Almanac
09:30 willie_sutton: I should say that I've been looking at your option dashboard as well, but I'm not sure how it works.  I'm slow as you know.  I understand that you calculated an approximate delta, but i'm unsure how that would be applied across multiple strikes.  I'll keep at it.
09:31 Vimes: externals might not stick - but a site that allows a quick view of seasonal trends
http://marketqview.com/seasonalchart.php?ID=75
09:33 Vimes: would suggest october is actually historically strong into eoy
09:41 MTS1: Willie; it would be cool if you left headers / attribution / comments in the code.
09:42 MTS1: and give it a name
09:44 willie_sutton: agreed
09:45 willie_sutton: Call it:
#it plots the bid and ask of a manually entered option.
09:47 cajun: willie, building on MTS, how bout specifying what you changed/added to mobius work
09:48 willie_sutton: apologies to all
09:50 Paris: MTS - I've annotated Willie's suggested nomenclature on my end. All good on my end
09:50 MTS1: Appreciate the sharing! Just feedback as I didn' see headers or what it does or attribution to original code / enhancements. I see you left comments in further down, but a header would be nice.
09:52 willie_sutton: all the attributions were mobius'
09:53 kjg: Hello - can anyone tell me how to add a chart to show a study only.  don't need price..
09:54 Vimes: somewhere in settings hide price
09:55 MTS1: There's a function also to do it in a script; just searched for hide in the reference; hidePricePlot()
09:57 Paris: Willie, since your posted study plots the bid/ask of a manually entered option, I have tagged your study with the following header in my archives as a placeholder.
# Bid and Ask OPRA Code
# willie_sutton
# 10.24.2018
09:57 willie_sutton: i love that
09:57 Paris: Thanks for your contribution Willie!
09:58 kjg: Vimes, MTS1 - thank you - I'll check it out
10:00 willie_sutton: I must admit that i didn't fuly understand Mobius' cloud shading; so you can add this if you like:
# for addCloud, green denotes when someone hits the ask price, red denotes hitting the bid
10:01 Paris: Noted
10:06 JohnnyQuotron: Willie... like Paris I will be adding a header to the mobius script you altered.  Please, where ever possible add an authorship header to your scripts and if you are adjusting someone else's code comments regarding the changes are particularly helpful.  Mobius code is considered the "Gold Standard" and relied upon without hesitation..  if you are adjusting his code, particularly his logic or math, it is critical that those looking at your script next week or next year know where it deviated from the "Gold Standard".  Thank you.

10:17 JohnnyQuotron: Morning D
10:18 willie_sutton: Sorry johnny, I'm new here
10:20 Nube: Traders Almanac is a great book to the get the hamster wheel spinning.
10:30 JohnnyQuotron: willie... no need to be sorry.  I apologize if I came of as being gruff.  I'm glad you're here and contributing.  I'm just thinking about a Community OneNote reader looking at your script six months from now.  If you haven't visited the Community OneNote here is the public link    https://1drv.ms/u/s!AnkeHrrRM_cvgxQTl1xckINYlKhZ
10:32 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current.  BBL
10:32 Mobius: DMonkey - Love your naming convention in that study. So creative  :)
10:36 JohnnyQuotron: Mobius... imagine Limbo Bars using that naming convention xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
10:45 Mobius: ha.. that's be about right

11:18 Steve: I'm new; how do I add a 200 day moving average to a chart?
11:19 Farmin: click on the studies button, then add study then find 'SimpleMovingAverage'
11:21 amalia: Steve, after clicking on the studies button then adding "SimpleMovingAverage", I would contact support@thinkorswim.com and ask for a platform tour. They're pretty good at answering all your questions. Welcome to TDA.
11:22 Steve: I can find Moving Averages, but not SimpleMovingAverage
11:23 amalia: Stick to the ones you can find then.
11:24 Steve: i found simpel moving agevage
11:25 amalia: Great.
11:25 Steve: I think thats it; do I have to do anything to change it to 200 or does it come that way
11:25 amalia: There's inputs you can change if it's not 200
11:27 Steve: ok; i have it; thanks
11:28 Farmin: this link may help in your education - http://tlc.thinkorswim.com/center/howToTos.html
11:55 Doogy_Chump: hi everyone, has anyone a version of Mobius " Stochastic Normalized to Price" that works in an alert (in TOS charts)????
12:00 MTS1: the alert function should work
12:06 Doogy_Chump: I get different erro signs, depending on which version, like this is one; " Error processing referenced script Stoch_Normalized_to_Price_WithMAcross: No such function: HighestAll at 1:33
Expected double
Expected interface com.devexperts.tos.thinkscript.data.IDataHolder at 1:19"
12:07 MTS1: sounds like you're trying to reference the study in a MarketWatch alert; not TOS Charts
12:07 amalia: What's the script you modified?
12:07 amalia: Ah
12:08 Doogy_Chump: 
Stochastic_Normalized_to_Price
# Stochastic Normalized to Price With no Fibonacci Lines
# Client Request
# 11.21.2013
12:13 FrankB3: Mr. Mo:  Like your RSI_Laguerre, but would it defeat the purpose of the RSI, if the FE line crosses the RSI for a better read ???  I know Doc S. does not use the indicator that way,, but I like simple reads ???    http://tos.mx/V2qr6t#
12:15 MTS1: Frank; as I understand those are separate signals; the RSI crossing oversold/bought may be a signal, but not it crossing FE. FE has it's own, separate, meaning.
12:17 FrankB3:  Yep,, I never get it right:  do you think it could give a more definite read ???
12:18 MTS1: Doogy; is that from his MyTrade? Not sure about the script without seeing it; but you can add an alert function in the script to run it on your charts with alerts if that's what you need. Otherwise you can try setting it up as a scan - dynamic watchlist and set alerts on that. The MW alerts are more restrictive on what is allowed code wise. Not sure which one you're attempting based on your error sounded like it was not charts.
12:18 Nube: That indicator is fast enough that you could use FE as the singla line
12:19 MTS1: right, just as crossing the middle, but that was not the purpose of FE, then you're just using it as a random crossing line.
12:20 Nube: A bar or two later getting in or out and less chop probably wash each other out.
12:21 Nube: Correct about that, MTS. Not the purpose, just happens to be fast enough that it likely won't kill the results.
12:22 Doogy_Chump: Thanks, MTS1 and others. Its TOS charts, where I right click and choose the creeate alert dialog box. I think i will strip it down to the bear minimun and see if I can get that to work?
12:24 MTS1: Frank; I have mine set to color white when it starts turning in OS/OB area, green when going up or maxed out (typically from OS), red when going down. It typically does not spend much time in the 'middle'. between os/ob, and the white gives you a head start to pay attention.
12:26 MTS1: Doogy; that creates a MW alert. Manual has restrictions listed; like no recursion. If script has that will probably be hard to change. Try the alert function first if that works for you; but that one only works in TOS and no eml/sms
11:05 YClan: Amalia,  100 points on 25,000 down is nothing much.. but then again, I don't play the Dow, because it's rigged to generally go up  (that's why they kicked out GE recently)
11:05 amalia: "rigged"
11:05 amalia: lol
11:05 RandomDan: I am shocked, shocked
11:06 lilFish: no doubt vol, fred
11:06 invertedhammer: Cl breaks this time
11:06 lilFish: rigged, whaa?
11:06 amalia: 100tick of /YM = $500 per contract.
11:06 lilFish: lol
11:06 amalia: btw GM YClan
11:06 VolCrush: well it is true that the original DOW would be at zero now had they not changed the portfolio 
11:06 amalia: But that's the idea of an index
11:07 amalia: Have parameters, take in/out those that do/don't fit 
11:07 VolCrush: i think that was what he was referring to as rigged
11:07 amalia: If that's what you call rigged, I'll concede.
11:08 amalia: Rather, it's been said like it's a bad thing.
11:08 amalia: *being
11:08 fred__w: the rigged thing  true or not  is a nonissue
11:08 VolCrush: not me the other dude, i couldnt give a chit of wat is or is not rigged
11:08 lilFish: yea the mkt moves up and down either way
11:09 VolCrush: i only move up and down on Saturdays
11:09 YClan: amalia,  soon Dow will kick out other non-performer... like.. TRV or WBA/walgreens and put AMZN on it since AMZN is worth almost USA GDP.
11:09 fred__w: lil  the only way to make money is volatility
11:09 lilFish: yup fred
11:09 lilFish: I"m day trading for now
11:09 lilFish: it's def a day trader's mkt
11:09 amalia: =)
11:09 fred__w: and im a position trader
11:10 lilFish: I"m usually a net seller
11:10 Chris: F is doing exactly what I predicted but I think I'm too far OTM
11:11 radon224: "The Dow components are chosen by Dow Jones Indicies, and there are no specific rules for inclusion.  Generally speaking, components of the Dow should be "large and respected" companies."  So there ya have it.  It's a club.
11:11 amalia: um
11:11 amalia: Buy /YM.
11:12 tmoney20g: some of the YM or all of the YM ?
11:13 YClan: radon,  I guess it means GE was not longer respected.
11:16 amalia: Personally, if I get swing triggers, I mainly do it on Beta>1.2 tickers
11:16 YClan: >>  Citigroup was subsequently removed from the Dow following the 2008 financial crisis, when the company's market cap shrank by over 90%
11:16 amalia: There's only 15 last time I checked. 
11:17 Lee: Citi share price was below 5. Til they rushed a reverse split
11:18 featherweight: Phew energy saving me
11:18 VolCrush: a buddy of mine bot Citi for less than $2 IIRC, hes now retired
11:18 efu: how many of originals of dow remain
11:18 fred__w: 0
11:19 efu: what would the dow bw
11:19 VolCrush: zero, but same can be said about S&P500
11:19 efu: e worth without replacements?
11:20 radon224: GE was the last one
11:20 fred__w: the point is  every company fails over time
11:20 radon224: of the original 12, not 30
11:20 efu: vol thanks. so in a way dow is zero
11:20 lilFish: vol, what is iirc?
11:20 tmoney20g: if i recall
11:20 VolCrush: if i recall correctly
11:21 lilFish: c only went down to $14ish
11:21 tmoney20g: not in 2008
11:21 tmoney20g: maybe
11:21 RandomDan: I use IIRC when I am too lazy to google it
11:21 lilFish: got it
11:21 VolCrush: whatever, he bot one of the banks at around 2, and it went up, but when i say he bot , he leveraged his house, i mean he BOT
11:22 amalia: Your portfolio: You clear out and flatten all position on the losing ones, right? Indices do the same. 
11:22 tmoney20g: i had a buddy put his life savings in fannie mae right after the crash
11:22 tmoney20g: he turned like 15k into 500k
11:22 lilFish: whoa
11:22 lilFish: major whoosh
11:22 esmal: nice
11:22 esmal: take it all out and put it on black next
11:23 VolCrush: MOST amanzing trade that i personally witnessed and know of, he tried to get me to do it, i did not
11:23 esmal: i wish i had that kind of risk taking / foresight, i like slow and steady
11:23 amalia: You'd like /YM then
11:23 amalia: lol
11:23 lilFish: i have a frd that bot a bunch of pir at .25 and sold it close to $25
11:24 lilFish: bot a ranch wit it
11:24 VolCrush: nice
11:25 esmal: damn
11:27 tmoney20g: i'm in vol, 1 c1800

11:29 tmoney20g: not sure if he sold them, or just cost averaged 3 x 100 purchases
11:29 YClan: natgas is wanting to move lower  (/NG and UNG/DGAZ), but keeps stalling.
11:31 YClan: :30 News Bot: Italian Finance Minister Tria says if tomorrow we see a repeat of 2008 crisis, the budget will be changed 
11:31 YClan: (in other words, we're not changing the budget unless if a super big crisis hits)
11:33 VolCrush: wait for the train wreck, then and only then change the speed limit
11:33 lilFish: /es
11:34 radon224: Brussels "rejecting" Italy budget, what a hoot.  Seems like if you join the EU you give up your national soverigenty.
11:34 tmoney20g: alright, lunch is over, start buying
11:35 tmoney20g: nq +100, move it
11:37 blondetrader: hmmmm

11:54 stockhawk: this market is struggling to find its balance...lots left to be sorted out for sure.
11:55 RandomDan: here was the higher loe
11:55 amalia: stockhawk, I'm going to be a nuisance by asking if you can change your font color. I keep thinking the admins are typing. Green is usually reserved for admins, is why. Thanks
11:55 RandomDan: low
11:55 RandomDan: lets see if we get a higher high
11:55 stockhawk: understood :)

11:59 stockhawk: VolCrush> I use SPX for judging the marlet as a whole, for your info
12:00 YClan: hawk,  me too..   I use SPX/SP500 as a baseline.  Try to find tickers moving stronger than the baseline/SPX
12:01 stockhawk: Yclan> yes but I also gann's square of nine,  swingcharts and patterns for entry.
12:02 Mummy: Does anyone know how i can perform a scan to find the bid and ask price spread?
12:03 amalia: Not possible, Mummy.
12:03 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: is Apple the new JP morgan?  :)
12:04 chenmann: doom
12:04 chenmann: they tried and failed
12:05 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: think the apple board is single handedly preventing a steep drop in market.  Their stock keeps haning on....amazing
12:05 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: hanging
12:07 stockhawk: YClan> I believe that unless we re-test the 2674/91, this market will continue to act wildly. I wanna see a test of this week's low for intermediate trading, and only till that happens i will continue daytrading.
12:07 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: if apple finally breaks this market is going DOWN BIGLY.....imho.....or is it BIGGLY?  :)
12:07 IMDora: Agreed about APPL

12:27 YClan: :12 News Bot: Fed's Mester (Voter, Hawk) says a prolonged market downturn and buildup in risks would affect US economic data, not adjusting her policy stance based on the recent market drop 
12:28 radon224: Haha, so now the Market will say "Oh Yeah?? Watch This!!!"

12:36 tmoney20g: it'll ball up
12:36 radon224: the frame of reference is the bike, not the bystander....so the answer is yes
12:36 DrHouse: Guess AMD earnings are going to be stellar...
12:36 tmoney20g: and create so much energy it'l blow out the front tire
12:36 lilFish: lol
12:37 VolCrush: the light will come on but you wont see anything
12:37 radon224: cause you be dead
12:37 DrHouse: Or blind
12:37 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: accelerate slowly.
12:37 VolCrush: she wears a helmet 24/7
12:37 lilFish: ha ha!
12:37 radon224: the air molecules at that speed would disentegrate you
12:38 VolCrush: if she cn pedal to the speed of sound, i wanna meet her legs
12:38 lilFish: all i know is ups accelerating toward my scale in price
12:38 VolCrush: welp they wear bronw shorts
12:39 radon224: Imo, this up/down only gets worse running up to the elections
12:39 radon224: Confucius Say: Politician is one who hake your hand before elections, and your confidence after
12:39 lilFish: think it'll be more down than up, but just thinking out loud
12:39 fred__w: lil  nothing can go that fast as its mass increases exponentially
12:39 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: apple hammer getting hammered
12:39 radon224: /shake
12:40 tmoney20g: little too late to buy puts tho
12:40 tmoney20g: or is it
12:40 lilFish: light can 
12:40 lilFish: and bt typing fingers
12:41 tmoney20g: could nq get destroyed overnight with ERs
12:41 fred__w: light cant ride a bike  
12:41 lilFish: who says
12:41 VolCrush: of course it can
12:42 TnT: most bikes don't go that fast
12:42 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: Everything else is testing the 200 day...if apple does that it goes to 188.   you're talking Nasdaq haircut of 300 points maybe.  just guessing on the 300
12:42 blondetrader: I would not be buying puts they r prob $$$$$$$$$$$$$
12:43 blondetrader: but maybe in a position to start planning the call buys
12:43 lilFish: i had a couple earlier and jumped out way too early
12:43 radon224: I want to make a play on SVXY soon I think
12:44 blondetrader: I will be looking for sure
12:44 VolCrush: must say /rty has been a beacon of clarity these last few weeks
12:44 blondetrader: :)
12:44 blondetrader: it doesnt lie
12:44 lilFish: the canary
12:44 tmoney20g: i'll just call it a day and restart tomorrow
12:45 blondetrader: we should reach a low by tomorrow /fri
12:45 VolCrush: welp, just so u know 1720 has been S on AMZN 
12:45 VolCrush: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^TMONEY
12:46 tmoney20g: ya, but if NQ/ES drops, it'll drop too
12:46 VolCrush: foh shu
12:46 tmoney20g: depending on ER reports tonight
12:46 blondetrader: 1700 looks doable
12:46 tmoney20g: i can't see intel being spectacular
12:46 VolCrush: yup
12:46 VolCrush: nah i tink the number will be from MSFT
12:47 tmoney20g: who else, amd tonight ?
12:47 VolCrush: dunno, sorry but its a full plate fo sho
12:48 tmoney20g: ya, and tomorrow before market too
12:48 tmoney20g: chittone
12:48 blondetrader: depending upon close tonight might be worth being an early bird tomorrow
12:48 VolCrush: 1700 luks doable??? heck you should do  a chart on me, im doable
12:48 blondetrader: lol
12:48 stockhawk: just covered my ADNT  short 
12:49 TnT: interesting, hogs limit up
12:49 VolCrush: limit???
12:49 TnT: up 3 cents
12:49 TnT: limit
12:34 Mobius: Who was it that said yesterday was pretty bullish. Welcome to a volatile two sided market
12:36 Mobius: As regards RSI Laguerre with FE. The FE in that study adjusts RSI length. There's no correlation to RSI and FE. RSI is the momentum signal. FE only shows trending or not trending and doesn't show whether the trend is up or down, strong or weak.
12:36 FrankB3:  Nube/ MTS  : Well thanks for your imput,,,  Watched Doc S. seminar on FE every month,,, will get it some day.  
12:36 Mobius: I wrote that study long before Doc ever saw it.

12:43 MTS1: Thanks Mobius!
12:44 Mobius: I don't think Doc was a good fit with DK and gang. He's far too low key
12:46 MTS1: Doc is good teaching yes, but still sometimes confusing or hard to execute rules. I'm still lost as far as FE is concerned as far as actionable w proven consistency. I may not have the right settings or look at it correctly still; even after reviewing script notes or watching Doc.
12:46 MTS1: thought they liked low key / calmnes, during trading anyway.
12:46 Mobius: Doc has a nice thoughtful approach to options trading. Spread risk with many smaller trades. Be patient and go for the long haul with a reasonable approach to making an income
12:47 Mobius: FE is NOT a trading signal. It never was and never will be.
12:47 MTS1: Sounds similar to DK to me? Though Doc more based on TA and DK more based on stats / extremes.
12:49 Mobius: DK doesn't fit into any catagory of typical trader.
12:49 Mobius: He's just DK. In his own DK world  :)
12:50 MTS1: Maybe because of Doc vids took FE as trending indicator; when high there's energy left for trend to continue, and when low trend may be stopping and going to contractoin or even reverse. He was not execuring rsi signal if FE did not give go ahead that there'
12:50 MTS1: d be energy
12:51 Mobius: FE is really simple - High reading market flat and building energy. Low reading Market trending and expending energy. nothing more to it
12:54 FrankB3:    Thanks  Mr. Mo:: but a question on trade strategy:::  If a trader used a short term swing trade, say 3% profit or market on close on 3rd day:: could he make as much profit as long term holder of stocks, if his method had a high win rate???
13:13 Mobius: If such a trade system could be maintained
13:23 ChartChick: can anyone tell me how to watch CNBC News while watching my stock chart? I can't see what's going on while monitoring my stock... thanks
13:24 JohnnyQuotron: Mobius... if the OneNote had a Combined Signal Approach Section would that script belong in it?
13:25 amalia: Si
13:34 JohnnyQuotron: amalia.. is that Si 4 me?
13:35 amalia: Yes. It has CSA in the title and the section you're asking about is all about CSA so I say it fits well in that section.
13:37 JohnnyQuotron: Gratias tibi ago..
13:40 Blue_Oyster_Cult-: DId Doc leave DK ?
13:42 FrankB3: Anyway CSA sounds more scientifically from what I called "compound indicators" .   I think an example would be TTM_Squeeze or the P3_Squeeze ???  but I'm not scientifically, what ever that means
13:50 lawrence5684: Under the Analyze tab, under Positions and Simulated Trades, there are MODEL and INTEREST.  What model is best for projecting potential gains or losses on an individual stock for which put options are held?  What does INTEREST mean?  How do I use INTEREST in predicting potential outcomes for options held in a particular stock?
13:52 Vimes: Use teh default setting of Bjerksund-Stensland, and in my opinion teh interest impact is going to be the least important factor versus all the factors that influence option pricing
13:54 lawrence5684: Thank you VImes.  Actually that makes sense on the interest.  
14:02 bigworm: mobius you ever hear of using kernelized ridge regression as a classifier?
14:15 MTS1: BOC; check out his linked in page; and no mention of him in recend dk vids
14:16 Nube: Twas I who mentioned yesterday being bullish.
14:16 MTS1: ChartChick; If you want to watch it separately you can select 'detach' to have it in separate window. If you want to see what's going on find something else though;)
14:16 Nube: I think I might have been wrong. Still 45 minutes yet though...
14:17 MTS1: lol nube
14:17 Joebone87: nube...
14:17 Vimes: Thought you were selling from the top of that candle
14:17 Joebone87: i think the pipe bombs might have spoiled your rally
14:17 MTS1: I made up for yesterday, so I'm happier;)
14:18 MTS1: huh; missed something I guess Joe.
14:19 Vimes: Soros sending you messages?
14:19 Joebone87: lol
14:19 Nube: Vimes, I did but not with much conviction.
14:19 MTS1: saw somethign bout him but that's it; not paying attention as I don't see that impacting mkts. Will check news later.
14:20 admin_bkTOS: Please keep discussions thinkScript related
14:20 Nube: Will do, admin. Sorry.
14:20 Joebone87: sorry
14:23 MTS1: /vx not even breaching yesterday's high, barely ORH. .
14:36 Blue_Oyster_Cult-: 5 MTS1: BOC; check - thanks
14:37 Vimes: i wanted lower prices to start buying again, but know that its happening not so easy
14:37 Vimes: ^know = now,
14:41 FrankB3:    10:50 Paris: if you get a chance: do you  have any  "price cycle indicator""  or any thing that acts like such besides these;;, I was told some of these are not true cycle indiators, thanks..     http://tos.mx/nWV2sK#
14:44 Nube: Still 15 minutes yet for to close green.
14:44 Vimes: so you're saying theres a chance
14:46 FrankB3:   maybe two chances
14:57 MTS1: Vimes; have a suspicion we may not be done yet
14:57 Vimes: yep me too,
14:59 Nube: Still not limit now so we have hope.
15:03 Mobius: We touched 10% off the top /ES and bounced
15:04 Mobius: Almost made T10
15:04 Nube: That's gotta be a once per year kind of day
15:05 Vimes: to the tick impressive
15:05 JohnnyQuotron: Ouch...  5 minute chart?  T5 on the 10min
15:06 Nube: Emerging markets down a third as much as ES and a quarter as much as NQ.
15:07 Nube: After underperforming for 10 years, they have become the safe trade.
15:07 JohnnyQuotron: MoMo Oh No
15:07 Nube: And Bitcoin
15:07 JohnnyQuotron: bidding for msft at 95
15:07 bigworm: what is yoru take there mobius
15:08 FrankB3:     There was a time, I thought, when not being in a trade each week, was disturbing....  some how lost my greed
15:09 Vimes: TD to allow trading through ALEXA
15:09 Nube: Alexa, short me some spus
15:10 Vimes: what could possibly go wrong
15:12 JohnnyQuotron: you know if Jay Powell comes out tomorrow and says the fed is not locked into raising rates in each on the next six quarters and is in fact looking at trade issues and is data dependant the S&P will be up 300-500
15:13 JohnnyQuotron: Quote of the day....."Thank you sir, may I have another."  
15:17 Vimes: There was a random request yesterday for a pine script translation so starting poking around for other interesting scripts, thought this was an interesting take on a donchian type channel:
#Source idea from "eykpunter" on trading view
#transalted to to tos
#Fib Zone Channels
#vimes
#18/10/24
input per=21;
plot hl=highest(high[1],per);
plot ll=lowest(low[1],per);
def dist=hl-ll;
plot hf=hl-dist*0.236;
plot cfh=hl-dist*0.382;
plot cfl=hl-dist*0.618;
plot lf=hl-dist*0.764;
hl.SetDefaultColor(color = Color.GRAY);
ll.SetDefaultColor(color = Color.GRAY);
hf.SetDefaultColor(color = Color.GRAY);
cfh.SetDefaultColor(color = Color.GRAY);
cfl.SetDefaultColor(color = Color.GRAY);
lf.SetDefaultColor(color = Color.GRAY);
addcloud(hl,hf,color.light_green);
addcloud(cfh,cfl,color.light_gray);
addcloud(lf,ll,color.light_red);
15:24 FrankB3: Thanks  Vimes,   intresting
15:28 Vimes: Perhaps another interesting take, using two lookbacks
#"[RS]Support and Resistance V0"
#Port of public tradingview script from R Santos
#Donchian Style Channels
#coded in TOS
input window1 = 8;
input window2 = 21;
plot top1 = highest(high, window1);
plot bot1 = lowest(low, window1);
plot top2 = highest(high, window2);
plot bot2 = lowest(low, window2);
top1.setdefaultColor(color.white);
top2.setdefaultColor(color.white);
bot1.setdefaultColor(color.white);
bot2.setdefaultColor(color.white);
addcloud(top2,top1,Color.light_orange);
addcloud(bot1,bot2,color.light_green);
13:03 Vimes: step, your example works for me back to max available data, daily bars, the low gets plotted
13:03 Nube: I have never tried this but there is a first() function and I can't say whether that will carry the value to other bars so first(low) might be worth a try
13:04 stepandfetchit:    Note that the first 9 bars have the issue!  -- the yellow is just plotting the low
13:05 stepandfetchit: What am I doing wrong?  -- 
13:05 Nube: post the code, step
13:06 Vimes: here's my same example, and it seems to work:
13:06 Nube: May well be doing nothing wrong
13:06 stepandfetchit: Good point!  Let me do a clean build.  Likely something else is causing the greif!
13:08 AlphaInvestor: Step - who the heck cares what the low was 15 years ago, really?
13:09 stepandfetchit: Vimes:  Thanks!  -- I must have a bug.
13:09 AlphaInvestor: Or, asked a different way.   How will knowing what the low was 15 years ago make you more money tomorrow?
13:10 stepandfetchit: Alpha... This thnkscrpt is examining distance between new lows, so begins with most historice point, and advances to recient, so need it to START!
13:11 AlphaInvestor: so if it starts 15 years minus 9 days instead of a full 15 years ago your strategy is ruined?
13:12 Vimes: again i think for most studies there is a prefetch that is automatic, though not familiar 100%, if you really want to take care of initializing a variable use compoundvalue
13:12 AlphaInvestor: prefetch works on all Moving Averages
13:12 Vimes: oic
13:13 AlphaInvestor: since BollingerBands includes a moving average, it works too
13:14 AlphaInvestor: sometimes, if you include a moving average in you list of studies, it will do the prefetch for all the other studies too ... YMMV
13:14 AlphaInvestor: this is consistently inconsistent
13:15 MTS1: "Three thinkScript� functions use prefetch: ExpAverage, EMA2, and WildersAverage." http://tlc.thinkorswim.com/center/howToTos/tutorials/Advanced/Chapter-12---Past-Offset-and-Prefetch.html; but I thought the SMA also. .
13:17 Nube: Average will, MTS. through a 200 day on a chart and it will plot from the first bar.
13:17 Nube: *Throw
13:17 MTS1: Yea; even the documentation that is there cannot always be relied on;)
13:17 AlphaInvestor: well, average is a moving average ... so
13:18 MTS1: Point is when I read doc before it specifically states EMA's and then lists the 3; I did not think it was all MA's which is why I looked it up again.
13:21 MTS1: Hm; maybe that's how the scanner looks back further; we found the other day the scanner not looking back as far as doc states, but maybe doc is considering prefetch also?
13:22 stepandfetchit: @ Alpha...  I just need to programatically determine when valid data can be referenced.  So, in this case, if  KNEW the first 9 bars were not avail, then I just start with next bar. So, if this IS related to "prefetch" amount, If I can compute the #bars of prefetct, I can use that to avoid the issue.  Is there a way to compute PREFETCH withing a thinkscript?
13:23 AlphaInvestor: Nube answered that use isNAN() to determine when you don't have valid data
13:24 AlphaInvestor: Does anybody else have a problem with either a) the Study  AccountNetLiq ... or b) the function   GetNetLiq()
13:25 AlphaInvestor: I have never had it return a net liq for me
13:25 stepandfetchit: Alpha... That does not work for the leading  (oldest) case!  -- 
13:26 stepandfetchit: I'll figure something out.
13:26 AlphaInvestor: what, you cannot use isnan() on the first 9 bars of the chart ... huh?
13:26 stepandfetchit: correct!
13:26 AlphaInvestor: that function should work on any bar on the chart
13:27 stepandfetchit: Agreed!
13:27 stepandfetchit: There is some "prefetch" issue I am bumping into
13:27 stepandfetchit: I will hack arround it, but was hopeing for a more elegent solution.
13:28 stepandfetchit: I may toy with that "compound" function (which I have not been using)
13:28 MTS1: steph, this has nothing to do with prefetch
13:29 AlphaInvestor: what exactly are you trying to do?
13:29 stepandfetchit: MTS1:  Can you enlighten me?  -- you are probalby correct,
13:29 MTS1: isnan works on any bar, but so should low. .
13:29 MTS1: Steph; look at the link I posted
13:30 AlphaInvestor: Step - if you are trying to do something like     close > low[9]     that is pulling data from 9 bars ago ... which won't work on the first 9 bars because that data won't exist
13:31 AlphaInvestor: compoundvalue cannot pull data from before the start of the chart either
13:32 stepandfetchit: Ah!  So, is NOT related to Prefetch (per your above ref).   Do you know what it May be related to?  -- is influenced by chart size (# bars trying to show), and influenced by any look-back references.
13:32 MTS1: but refering to prefetch close > Avg(low,1)[9] may work.
13:32 AlphaInvestor: what is the    IT    you refer to
13:32 MTS1: No steph; sounds like a data feed issue
13:33 MTS1: ignore my avg prefetch example; it only pre-fetches the number of bars data needed for the average.
13:37 AlphaInvestor: Tculs - do you or anybody working the Trade Desk today have any experience with either a) the Study  AccountNetLiq ... or b) the function   GetNetLiq()
13:39 stepandfetchit: Kinda interesting observation:  Attempt to plot "barnumber()", missing the leading bars as well!
13:40 MTS1: AI; I have nothign special in my accout and both seem to work for me. Have you tried emailing TS Support?
13:40 AlphaInvestor: all symbols, or just one symbol?
13:41 AlphaInvestor: MTS - I haven't, I was gunna call today to discuss ... but was asking Tculs if anybody with knowledge was in to discuss it with me
13:44 AlphaInvestor: MTS - I have a couple "special" things in my portfolio. One with a Q at then end of the symbol, one worth 0.0003 per share, a couple recent spinouts, and 10 leftover Washington Mutual Inc Escrow thingies
13:44 MTS1: I've not tried often, but seems eml is easier for TS specific issue; not timely respose but probably gets to the right person to answer. Seems like TradeDesk has to transfer / refer to TS team which when I've called after hours they said only in during the weekdays.
13:45 MTS1: But I've not been around long and go here for most my TS support needs;)
13:46 MTS1: Oh; no symbol; just just blank function w/o inputs and dropped the study on a chart; happened to be $TICKAR chart;)
13:46 stepandfetchit: If interested:  This seems to find the "mysterious" leading "unreferenceable BARS": def secret = first(barnumber());
13:50 AlphaInvestor: MTS - what is the TS Support e-mail?
13:50 MTS1: Steph; guess not sure what the issue with IT is; or why your script would not work because of it. Pretend the first bars are not there and the chart starts after that? It sounds weird, but is what it is I guess. Can pass it to support and see what they find; but probably need to give them ticker and chart timeframe.
13:52 MTS1: AI; thinkscript@thinkorswim.com is what I've used.
13:53 Burns56: Hi I am looking for some help on how to combine 3 lower studies into one complete study, I can easily do it on my computer but i am trying to combine to see if they will load on my ipad , any help would be greatly appreciated                                                                  ## TD Ameritrade IP Company, Inc.

13:54 MTS1: Burns; did you see what that looked like before you hit enter?
13:55 stepandfetchit: MTS1:  I think I can code arround this now, using that First(barnum.. kludge!  
13:55 Vimes: still not sure its an issue if you had a more reasonable chart horizon i doubt you would see the issue
13:56 Vimes: and even on my chart with 15 years it works fine
13:56 Burns56: http://tos.mx/swR1qD#
13:56 Vimes: Burns, has redacted his own study
13:58 stepandfetchit: Vimes:  Some of my scripts requrie some lookback/lookforward, so looking for a generic solution for them as well. --  This seems to be at least a partial solution for me.
14:01 JohnnyQs_BackupWks: the LoungeArchive is current.  It even contains Burns56's invisible study
14:01 AlphaInvestor: Thanks MTS - emailing them now
14:02 Burns56: I apologize its like i am using disappearing typing, Help
14:02 MTS1: Burns; I won't open a workspace I don't need unless maybe I'm in PM; maybe try sharing the chart or the script? As for posting script directly in here; try to run it through something like notepad so that there is no extra formatting like from e-mail or word etc added.
14:02 Vimes: step, i get that but i guess what i'm saying is even if you have let's say a 6M, 1D chart with a 9 period lookback TOS will still look past your current chart setting, you typically do not need to do anything special:  This is plottting close[9] for example.
14:03 MTS1: Burns; please exit and re-enter the room to fix your font.
14:05 MTS1: Vimes; not what I've seen; is that the far left of your chart? Maybe they changed somethign. .
14:05 Vimes: that is the left of my chart,yes
14:05 Vimes: no other lower studies or upper studies
14:05 Burns56: I apologize it’s like my keyboard has turned into invisible ink

14:08 MTS1: That is strange Vimes; I think that may be new. Just tried it on shorter SPY chart and see the same as you, with max available is the only time it starts after the lookback index period. .
14:08 Burns56: I’m sorry if it didn’t come out correctly I don’t have a lot of experience with posting here. But it’s three separate lower studies that I’m trying to combine into one so hopefully I can load on my phone when I’m traveling
14:09 MTS1: Burns; on your PC exit the room and re-enter that will fix it.
14:10 MTS1: Then see if you have a better formatted script that you can paste from notepad
14:11 stepandfetchit: If anyone is interested in an example for what I observer on certain Symbols when time frame is very very large, here is simple script:
14:11 stepandfetchit: 
plot apriorclose=close[5];
def secret = first(barnumber());
plot sc=secret;
addlabel(1,secret);
#
14:12 AlphaInvestor: WOW!!! that script from Burns is even worse now that I can see it
14:12 stepandfetchit: Use VXX or UVXY with 15 years to observe, then switch to spy or something
14:12 MTS1: Burns; Also at first glance it looks like you should just be able to append the scripts together into one; just take out the extra 'declare lowers'. The issue may be scaling; in which case the studies have to be normalized. May be easier to just overlay the 3 scripts in which case TOS does the normalization automagically.
14:12 amalia: lol
14:12 MTS1: Using white background now AI?
14:12 MTS1: ;)
14:12 MTS1: Oh the re-post. .
14:14 MTS1: First one actually looked better;)
14:16 Burns56:  
14:16 hbmicro: AI, Burnout again???
14:16 Burns56: sorry is that to big?
14:16 Burns56: 75% reduced
14:18 MTS1: Burns; what are those 3 different indicators at the bottom?
14:18 amalia: Try 10
14:18 Burns56: "WOW!!! that script from Burns is even worse now that I can see it" Omg i needed a belly laugh thanks / now you know you are dealing with a genius. sorry i will exit stage left
14:20 Burns56: RSI, This indicator that this gentlemean hahn shared and i modified a little and another called traders tips divergence that i dont know how or when i got it
14:20 MTS1: So RSI goes between 0 and 100; the other ones?
14:21 Burns56: i can post them one at a time or probably better to not torture you guys with my insanity
14:22 Burns56: the rsi is standard
14:22 amalia: One at a time is good
14:22 AlphaInvestor: Burns - try to get them to post in their original format ... not all turned into one big long line
14:22 AlphaInvestor: and yes, one at a time

14:29 Burns56: This is the third studythey all work fine when I combined them separately on my computer into one lower chart individually
14:30 Burns56: I would like to be able to write them into one study combined without having three separate lower studies because I haven’t figured out how to combine three separate studies on my iPad manually
14:30 Vimes: the advantage of having them separate is when you drag them together TOS will autofit them to the lower panel, why do you want them in one study again?
14:30 Vimes: ^
14:30 Vimes: oh
14:31 Burns56: Yeah when I’m traveling I’d like to be able to get out of the SPY using this chart I guess I could bring my laptop
14:31 MTS1: Burns; the first study does not work; it has a function Li in there that does not exist; you probably have a typo.
14:32 Vimes: out of curiousity what are you trading that you want to see divergence with CL and correlation with SPX?
14:32 Burns56: Sorry the first studyis just a standard RSI that comes loaded in thinkorswim I must’ve copied and paste it it incorrectly
14:32 Vimes: Li should be absvalue()
14:34 Burns56: Yeah it’s funny that it’s giving a pretty good signal for me when to get out of the market when one of the cyan line crosses below to exit in both cyan lines cross above the pink line to enterWhat do you can correlate it up just about against anything on the platform It gives you that potential
14:36 Burns56: Of course this was last year’s market conditions who knows now
14:38 Burns56: If anyone could improve on it that would be great .I’m just like a kindergartner working with it
14:39 MTS1: Well; this is what it looks like on one chart; not sure if normalizing would do much for you either:  
14:43 amalia: Well, glad that got settled. Next!
14:44 Nube: Burns, which condition for each of those indicators do you look for when deciding to exit?
14:46 amalia: Burns left.
14:50 AlphaInvestor: Sometimes peeps on phones and pads don't show up in the list of People in Room
14:50 amalia: Pictures or it didn’t happen
14:54 Nube: Maybe he's having Smithers monitor the chat for him.
14:55 AlphaInvestor: Nube - berged for TV prefereces ... I had to look that up
14:55 Burns56: Sorry I have something on the stove brb
14:56 Vimes: you never watched the simpsons alpha, cmon, man!
14:56 AlphaInvestor: I can say that I have never suffered thru a whole episode
14:56 MTS1: wow. .
14:57 Nube: Put together a silly Correlation Index and then got to thinking maybe o should take it serious. Anyone know what some of the most common factors are that quants tend to use? With there being an ETF for everything now we could probably see when those correlations get egg shaped
14:58 AlphaInvestor: Nube - I know the factors in common use
14:58 AlphaInvestor: most of the underlying data needed is not available in thinkScript
14:59 amalia: ^
15:00 amalia: >=|
15:00 MTS1: TCULS; could you please delete my picture? 
15:02 amalia: Why
15:03 Nube: Drats, Alpha. I was hoping to have it be simple.
15:04 Nube: If there isn't a price to sales etf, or price to ebit etc then we have ourselves a niche to fill.
15:05 twoshoes: TDA should start a "Fantasy ETF" league.
15:06 Vimes: nube, you may already know this but look up the crsp indexes, all (i believe) are available on TOS,
15:06 Vimes: http://www.crsp.com/indexes-pages/crsp-indexes-quick-reference-guide
15:06 Burns56: MTS thank you
15:07 amalia: yw
15:08 Nube: I didn't know that, Vimes. Thanks. That will help out a lot.
15:09 Vimes: it doesn't capture yet some of the volatility facotr investments but has the majority of the common investment styles tracked
15:09 AlphaInvestor: TwoShoes - one recently shut down, that I cannot name here
15:10 AlphaInvestor: Thanks Vimes - news to me too
15:15 Vimes: again, likely obvious but you would just use the index identifier for the symbol in tos, the totral return indexes can be helpful if you want to simulate returns with dividends, (however they don't have volume) so you wouldn't be able to get to carried away: CRSPTMT, for example
15:18 AlphaInvestor: For the week, the winning sectors were Utilities (+1.0%), and Consumer Staples (-4.0%) if you can call a -4% a winner. The losers were Materials (-9%), and Technology and Industrials (tied at -7.0%). This is using SPDR data pulled using TOS and RTD.
15:19 Vimes: that's definitely bearish, xlu, xlp leading
15:23 amalia: I started trading after Obama came into office. What is.... bearish?
15:24 AlphaInvestor: yung pup
15:25 AlphaInvestor: dats when minRange quits workin'
15:25 amalia: lmao
15:26 Nube: Emerging markets outperforming is not bearish.
15:26 Nube: So all is not lost yet
15:31 Nube: I'm not saying buy Brazilian Small Caps, mind you.
15:32 AlphaInvestor: Two of my "market posture" indicators went bearish on Thursday, the sector rotation model actually went bearish on 09/21
15:38 Nube: That was timely.
15:42 AlphaInvestor: belay that -- Big Hand went bearish on the daily chart, but should have been run on weekly. Still bulish now.
15:48 Nube: Pretty much every I have looks ill on the daily but weekly doesn't look worse than a normal market spill yet. There's always next week.
15:50 Nube: Limit down Sunday night is my hope.
15:50 AlphaInvestor: So I have 3 Market Posture indicators Bull, 2 Market Posture indicators Bear
15:57 Noob1: So it just occurred to me that Netflix reports on Tuesday. If mkt in the toilet could they even sail w/ gd er?
15:57 Noob1: Good earnings
16:04 MTS1: Or maybe good earnings will lift the market. . Not sure; my crystal ball indicator has a bug in it;)
16:05 MTS1: If you don't have an edge; don't play it
16:06 AlphaInvestor: since they are spheres, crystal balls don't have edges - just sayin'
16:07 MTS1: THAT's the problem with the indicator I guess; keeps going in loops!
16:08 amalia: lol
16:10 bsinks: This is pretty awesome.........didnt even know there was live chat rooms.
16:11 AlphaInvestor: Bsinks and Noob1 -- this chat room is for thinkScript coding discussions only. There are other live chat rooms open Monday to Friday if the market is open
16:12 MTS1: this one is pretty awsome though!
16:14 bsinks: Can I ask if there is a thinkscript for a custom column on the scanner for a time stamp so I can sort by time that a new stock hits the scanner.
16:15 AlphaInvestor: You can ask, that is a perfect question for this forum
16:15 AlphaInvestor: Unfortunately, there is not
16:15 bsinks: lol........story of my life.......thank you
16:17 MTS1: But if you save it as a query = dynamic watchlist, you can set it up to e-mail alerts to you when stcks get added (or removed); which you could sort in your e-mail reader.
16:18 AlphaInvestor: They will also show up in the order triggered in the Message Center
16:18 bsinks: yea thats how I watch it is in the message center......but it adds like 8 at a time
16:19 bsinks: still it works pretty good like that
16:19 Vimes: or even send you a mobile alert which is what i use
16:22 MTS1: Vimes; have you used other types also? Wonder about timing; seems like mobile alerts for order confirmations are sometimes very timely and sometimes delayed. Wonder if there can be a delay in any of the communicatoin methods and how MW alerts handles them.
16:23 Vimes: well i guess i should clarify that i'm using the trader app on mobile, it seems to alert at the exact same time as my pc platform
16:24 Vimes: even on pc  i think there is a dealy of a few minutes for watchlist alerts
16:25 MTS1: OK; have not tested / compared the different methods yet, but wonder if there's a difference between methods.
16:26 AlphaInvestor: Look at the LAST price for JPM ... does TOS know something that I haven't heard yet?
16:28 Vimes: maybe i'm not looking right, i see 106.95
16:30 AlphaInvestor: I got 0 on the Analyze Tab
16:30 AlphaInvestor: and a watchlist
16:31 AlphaInvestor: RTD pulls 106.95 -- curious
16:35 Nube: Push Alerts on the mobile app have been good in the little I have used them. Text and email are so so
16:44 JohnnyQs_BackupWks: The LoungeArchive is current.
16:45 amalia: Thanks
16:50 Paris: In case anyone is interested, I tracked down the second script that Burns56 posted. Seems that this was modified from a script that Nube posted on 7.13.2016 called BB Divergence with Mobius Standard Deviation Line.
16:53 AlphaInvestor: oh, that was back when Nube was but a noob
16:55 amalia: Thanks
16:56 amalia: Thanks
16:58 amalia: wtf
17:00 AlphaInvestor: amalia is very thankful today '-)
17:04 amalia: Dude somethings up w mobile app. It’s a recurrence
17:04 Nube: You're welcome
17:04 Burns56: Paris thank you do you have the original ? thanks
17:07 Paris: Here is the attribution of the 3 scripts that Burns56 posted earlier today.
Script 1: Standard TOS RSI study
Script 2: Modified from Nube's study called BB Divergence with Mobius Standard Deviation Line posted on 7.13.2006
Script 3: Relative Strength Scan from Hahn Tech
Note that Hahn's script is also available on Youtube
17:07 Burns56: yes thats where i got that one
17:08 Paris: Time for breakfast. BBL.
17:09 Nube: I forgot about that script. The idea was for the next step to change the bands to something more conventional but never followed through
17:10 AlphaInvestor: I have trouble reading those scripts that are all jumbled together because of the small text on my screen. However, It seems to me that it would be a happy accident that a study with /CL in it would be a good Combined Signal Approach candidate for all equities or indicies. The other two make sense, but are they really just the same thing in different clothing?
17:11 Burns56: it also looked good with $TICK and various $pcall symbols
17:12 Burns56: i checked it with some strong monthly sectors like health care and services too
17:14 Burns56: i thought it may have some potential with the vix too but i am just looking at different ideas
17:14 amalia: That’s what drew Nube’s attention away from it; looking at different ideas.
17:15 Paris: Burns56 - I'm on mobile, and to respond to your question, yes I do have Nube's original study of 2016, which is where I found the correspondence. Will be back in about an hour's time.
17:22 AlphaInvestor: got to go now - Later Traders
17:22 AlphaInvestor: Tculs - thanks for opening the room for us again today. You da bomb!
17:31 Vimes: i learned that if you hit the reformat code button, it will quickly fix the code that was pasted, just fyi
17:32 Farmin: majil
17:32 Farmin: majik
17:32 Farmin: now if they would just have a fix errors button
17:33 Vimes: thtat woudl be sweet, find replace would also be sort of convenient
17:34 Farmin: hmmm, like a grown up editor?
17:34 Vimes: exactly
17:44 Burns56: TZA symbol with $tick as secondary symbol looks interesting on that chart
17:51 Burns56:  
18:14 amalia: Uncheck Fit Studies
18:16 Bear: Hey
18:16 Bear: Does anyone know how to simulate buying trades?
18:20 amalia: OnDemand on paperMoney
18:25 G3_: Til Sunday eve open.  Good night tculs and all.
19:02 Farmin: bear, you have to hang around longer than that
19:21 amalia: Laters g3

05:44 slashgw: gm all
05:49 DMonkey: 👋
05:52 slashgw: hey DMonkey, gm.  here is the beginning of what I have been working on, based on that chartbubble code. https://screencast.com/t/54lIo4cNtAO
06:02 DMonkey: looks good
06:08 slashgw: thanks!  still working on the automation portion via Python.  able to pull the data easily enough from online, just working on formatting the output to the thinkscript file.
06:29 TICKZ: @slashgw who made that bband studie?
06:32 slashgw: tickz, that was made by a friend of mine
06:33 TICKZ: whats his name? i hve the same studie..but i dont know who made it..
06:33 slashgw: won't say his name, but initials are jb
06:33 TICKZ: ok
07:43 PhatDog: i've been trying for sometime now to come up with script to identify stocks that have less than 5 trades during the after hours/pre hours session.  anyone have such scrip?
07:44 MTS1: Phat; you could only potentially do this on a tick chart set to 1 tick, and count the bars after RTH. Look at the date/time functions for functions available to check when RTH ends.
07:47 Vimes: I don't think you can use ticks in the scanner though
07:51 PhatDog: i'd be good to count the 1 minute bars during that session.
07:52 Vimes: Phat, instead you could scan for a particular volume in pre-market
07:53 MTS1: Phat; assuming since you're looking for low volume and may not have multiple trades on the same 1 min bar that might work for you. What is the purpose of finding such stocks?
07:54 PhatDog: possibly, but ive been unable to come up with the scipt to capture a total volume during the session
07:55 Vimes: You're the first one i've heard want to look at low volume in pre-market as an indicator, but i know there have been several pre-market volume scans shared here -let me see if i have one saved
07:57 PhatDog: its one factor to identify low volume pre market stocks the move upward during the regular session
07:57 Vimes: Try this on a 1min agg in teh scanner with extended hours checked, you would need to adjust the volume threshold:
def Active = SecondsFromTime(0400) >= 0 and
                     SecondsTillTime(0930) > 0;
def vol = if Active and !Active[1]
                then volume
                else if Active
                        then vol[1] + volume
                        else vol[1];
plot isTrue = vol >= 500000;
07:59 Vimes: Phat, ok but that is going to be almost 100% of all stocks behavior (imo)
08:08 PhatDog: Vimes, tried your code with no other factors and just changed your vol to 5000 and no matches.
08:10 Vimes: works for me there are about 385 stocks >5000 and 8317!!! less than 5000 again low volume or low trade count is not going to find a needle in teh haystack so to speak
08:16 PhatDog: ah yes. so sorry. had another limiter still on.  THX!
08:16 Vimes: yw
08:27 MTS1: Logic seems contrarian to what most traders would be looking for volume wise.
------- Friday, October 12, 2018 -------
15:23 VolCrush: so bronx, don't u owe us something?
15:23 RandomDan: I think the market is set to go sideways, newsflow dependent.
15:24 blondetrader: lol
15:24 blondetrader: we didnt open 2780 so I only owe it to u
15:25 AlphaInvestor: So, WFC which missed E is up 1.3% today ... but JPM that beat E is down 1.09% today. What kinda bizarro world do we live in.
15:26 VolCrush: ok, i'll wait patiently for the "ping" on my phone
any second now, right?
15:26 blondetrader: keep watching for it
15:26 JC_chart: cuirious on rty trade
15:26 RandomDan: It's my fault Al. Fins going up as soon as I take a loss on my GS.
15:26 JC_chart: mind sharing your entry and exit and chart timeframe
15:26 RandomDan: but I don't feel like doing that
15:26 VolCrush: welp you Alpha, more than anyone here know that funnies don't mean chit with respect to how the market reacts
ergo, drop funnies
LOL
15:27 JC_chart: totally ok if you say no... just interested
15:27 VolCrush: i figured bronx, never keep your word....typical w
15:27 blondetrader: lol
15:27 blondetrader: well its not like i wear a tutu to trade
15:28 VolCrush: but u trade nekked , no?
15:28 blondetrader: JC I am flat rn
15:28 blondetrader: this was not the day I expected
15:28 blondetrader: haha no
15:28 JC_chart: did you hold it thru last night?
15:28 blondetrader: I did
15:28 blondetrader: and got stopped out this am
15:28 JC_chart: holy s**
15:28 JC_chart: that's a big stop LOL
15:29 blondetrader: no lol I made $$
15:29 RandomDan: bt, really. This is exactly the day I expected... using your TA!
15:29 JC_chart: i am sure you did
15:29 JC_chart: u were short right
15:29 AlphaInvestor: Vol - with both reporting the same day, they should have reacted in relation to their E results
15:29 blondetrader: :)
15:29 JC_chart: as of yesterday afternoon
15:29 blondetrader: no i was long into this am
15:29 VolCrush: welp send me a pic wearing red soled only then...........
15:29 JC_chart: ohhh i thought you were short
15:29 VolCrush: Alpha, they did
15:29 JC_chart: it went up 25 points
15:29 blondetrader: nooo I was on for the rally pffft
15:29 blondetrader: I was looking for 95 lol
15:30 RandomDan: she was long, I remember
15:30 JC_chart: what tiemframe do you use to identify entries
15:30 blondetrader: 4 hr mostly
15:30 blondetrader: and dly
15:30 RandomDan: so what about the day didn't go as you expected?
15:30 blondetrader: well Dan I thought the pop would have more teeth
15:30 blondetrader: this was like a little kitten
15:30 blondetrader: not a lion
15:31 RandomDan: I thought it was pretty good, considering the wreckage.
15:31 blondetrader: I would not be surprised to see another wave of selling monday am b4 we get any consecutive days of green
15:31 blondetrader: dissapointing
15:32 blondetrader: but i have some scary tgts lower
15:32 RandomDan: the day was a big cup, also a positive.
15:32 blondetrader: so to avoid mkt need to do some work
15:32 VolCrush: not a bad pop actually, only because the close was vary gud on /nq
so respectfully disagree
15:32 blondetrader: nq could rally another 100
15:32 blondetrader: and still look like shit
15:32 VolCrush: or more
15:33 blondetrader: btw that would be res for leg 2
15:33 blondetrader: anything over........we good
15:33 VolCrush: well we wanna buy chit, who wants to buy gud?
15:33 blondetrader: lol yes but if nq fails that
15:33 blondetrader: you can buy it a lot cheaper
15:33 VolCrush: sell against
15:34 blondetrader: like to the tune of67s
15:34 VolCrush: true but we got pick our lines in der sand
15:34 blondetrader: figure 150 off this weeks low would be next tgt dn
15:34 blondetrader: well nq needs to hold 7112
15:34 VolCrush: i gots my names for hunting season and will fall on my sword if necessary
15:34 JC_chart: we could have some violent upswing no doubt in the indexes but I think insitutions need market to drop more so they can buy it and bid it back up like they do in every cycle
15:35 blondetrader: yes
15:35 AlphaInvestor: I think this past couple days was selling der MoMo and a rotation into Quality. MSFT, ADBE and such did very well for me when those trades were put in this week during the downturn
15:35 blondetrader: as i mentioned we have a htf bear move happening that isnt complete momo wise
15:35 blondetrader: and we have a dly oversold
15:35 VolCrush: heck i wanted 6845 on /nq, when i called 7 k /nq i got laffed out of here 
15:35 blondetrader: so would make sense to get some relif
15:35 JC_chart: yeah 6800 is the midpoint for nq for a 1Y daily chart
15:36 VolCrush: ah hah, ty @JC
15:36 JC_chart: honestly all that matters is AMZN
15:37 JC_chart: so we should just trade that as it makes up what percent of NQ ... 60 haha
15:37 VolCrush: emmmm, der fruit is a playa and mr softie is now relevant for some reason
15:37 blondetrader: 1835 needs to break amzn
15:37 blondetrader: orr 1621 lol
15:38 blondetrader: rty closed red today
15:38 blondetrader: no bueno
15:38 VolCrush: either way lots of resistance with every pop now
15:38 JC_chart: RTY is very sick on my chart
15:38 VolCrush: yah true dat, rty is a big problem atm
15:39 blondetrader: honesly
15:39 VolCrush: yes dear
15:39 blondetrader: if it has to rinse like to get it done this month
15:39 JC_chart: it trendline has been down since 9/24 and the pitch of that line is steep not much releif soon unless earning are rocking
15:39 blondetrader: like before last week of oct
15:39 VolCrush: welp u wanna see a down trend line go see XLF
15:40 blondetrader: it made a lower low today lol
15:40 JC_chart: youre right it is sicker
15:40 blondetrader: and it leads imo
15:40 blondetrader: this turned 1-2 weeks b4 the others gave it up
15:41 JC_chart: so any of you ever traded wheat futures or soybeans?
15:41 blondetrader: yep
15:42 JC_chart: you know they have nive moves in the morning
15:42 blondetrader: I do :)
15:42 Bid_Ask: what's nive
15:42 JC_chart: and they are super volatile but i was thinking i almost like them better than es
15:42 blondetrader: for sun night mon am i am really leaning on selling rty
15:42 JC_chart: you have the same payout
15:42 blondetrader: they offer minis
15:43 blondetrader: imo the trend is more true in ags
15:43 JC_chart: i was sitting in soybeans yesterday and forgot about the monthlyr eport and it ripped about 5 dollars in a nano second
15:43 blondetrader: yea got to mind those report
15:44 JC_chart: i was lucky i was long it also whipped back so i did fine but yes that was my thought exactly when i  sold the contracts LOL
15:44 blondetrader: lol
15:45 JC_chart: when you speak of trend you are speaking of trend on daily right?
15:45 blondetrader: genericly yes
15:45 blondetrader: but I prefer when all time frames are in agreement
15:46 JC_chart: me too ibut i try to just focus on one chart
15:46 JC_chart: i look at the daily 30m for trend
15:46 JC_chart: and then trade the 3 or 1m
15:46 blondetrader: oh yea thats too small for me
15:46 JC_chart: i built some indicaotrs that are multitimeframe so that helps just using one chart
15:46 fred__w: jc  i use 3 charts for context  1yr-mo 3mo-wk 14da-da
15:47 fred__w: and look for >11ema
15:47 JC_chart: im happy with a 10 tick move on cl or gc moer is great but i am greatful for that
15:47 JC_chart: im not an ema fan
15:47 fred__w: jc  i do that to build probability
15:48 JC_chart: but i get why you use it so please dont misunderstand my intent
15:48 fred__w: jc  the particular method is not criotical  i was giving you a variation of bt's stmt
15:49 blondetrader: :)
15:49 blondetrader: I have errands......see you guys sund night
15:49 JC_chart: appreciat that

06:18 Bealzybub: Yo-Ga
06:43 Tom: When I was on Prophet Charts last Thursday, Oct.11 the days CHARTS showed up well.  On Fri. Oct.12 (as has been the case 1-2 times per month) the chart for Thurs. was simply not there.  This has become an all too frequent occurance in 2017 &2018. Now, for the first time, the last 2 trading days are NOT showine up on Prophet Charts.  Many times I have contacted Technical Support.  I have asked them if it is "my computer or your" responsibility and have been told they "are aware of the problem."  Now, for the first time, the last 2 trading days are NOT showine up on Prophet Charts.  What is every one else out there doing about this problem?  I suspect this problem started to occur when TD Ameritrade took over.  In my communication with support personel I have been told there are other 'changes' coming.  Good Grief...Does anyone in the community have a solution...other than going to ScottTrade?
06:50 Bealzybub: Wish I could help. I cant even get answers about the "Marketwatch" trade trending lines.
06:51 Bealzybub: Which is really no problem. I'll get it figured out one way or the other. I'm making my 4% per day.
06:51 Tom: Do you have the same problem on Prophet Charts?
06:52 Bealzybub: I dont even know what that is. Which is the same answer I get when asking about "Marketwatch".
06:53 Bealzybub: I mean I've just been asking the community here and havent bothered tech @ Ameritrade.
07:00 Tom: TDAmer took over ThinkOrSwim, which as their trading platform, has the wonderful old Investools platform (if I have the history correct), but the Tech Support people have not been able to solve this problem.  They admit it is their issue and not my computer.  When the went over to Ameritrade we lost many of the research abilities and one, in particular, indicator...Virtual Volume (VV%).  All of the placating and "education support" they've offered have been ineffective in helping together with direct conversation.  I've moved funds and not placed funds with them because of their lack of genuine support.  This is the first time I've gone public and have asked for anyone with solutions to the problem and any similar experience(s).  
07:02 Tom: Is anyone else out there using the ThinkOrSwim, Prophet Charts platform for trading, research, etc?
07:06 Tom: It is still early in the morning to get suffiecient responses, but as I've turned on the ThinkOrSwim website & platform, I've noticed that the past 2 trading days (last Thurs. & Friday) charts are simply not there, even though I used them on their given days!
07:39 nora: Hi Tom.   TDam had announced last year that they were not going to support/upgrade Prophet charts any more.  In fact it was supposed to go away.  I have used and still am trying to use Prophet charts but recognze its limitation.  I am surprised that it is still functioning and available.  The Tos charts have lots of problems amd limitations also.
07:40 nora: My prophet charts have thurs and Friday.
07:40 MTS1: Tom; TDA 'took over' Thinkorswim ages ago, as well as prophet charts and more recently invest tools. ScottTrade was the most recent addition that they took over, but did not intergrate their platform. Prophetcharts has been slated for retirement for a while also, when supposedly all features are moved to TOS, but still left in for legacy users complaining when it was removed. I would not continue relying on prophet as a primary platform considering the priorities within TDA / TOS, and see if the TOS side is a better fit.
07:41 Nube: Prophet charts are no longer supported with any particular concern so I wouldn't expect to continue to work with them
07:41 MTS1: So you're too late to move to ScottTr;)
07:44 nora: The TOS charting had a really tough time last Wed and Thurs because of the high volume.  The charts froze for different lengths of time and lagged fro others.   
07:44 dellsystem: Whats going on with WTW  no Last 
07:50 nora: i have a premarket last... for WTW, 66.88 fwiw
07:51 dellsystem: Yes the  Feed is not updating  Think or Swim
08:01 dellsystem: Just updated
08:01 dellsystem: and now retracted
08:02 Tom: Where are the rest of you with your charts & research?  Where are the great trading platforms today?
08:03 AlphaInvestor: #TOSisBoss
08:04 Tom: Sorry Alpha...but read my paragraphs, above.  I used to think the same as you!
08:05 AlphaInvestor: Prophet is being sunsetted, suck it up and use TOS charts
08:05 AlphaInvestor: I can no longer get parts for my Edsel either
08:06 Tom: My complaints are about TOS...I HAVE TOS, and Prophet charts are what is displayed!
08:06 radon224: Alpha, I can give you a link for Edsel parts if you need it
08:06 AlphaInvestor: Prophet Charts = bye bye
08:06 Tom: How do I make the switch you describe?
08:07 Tom: I've been with InvestTools, TOS since 2007 but have received no notices for any type of switch that I can recall.
08:08 AlphaInvestor: There are two charting systems right now in thinkorswim a) TOS charts, b) Prophet Charts. Learn to use A, because B is going away
08:10 tmoney20g: will do big daddy Al
08:10 gerardom: sup tmoney
08:10 tmoney20g: o hi gerar
08:10 AlphaInvestor: As MTS1 mentioned, we were told that all Prophet functionality would be moved to TOS charts before it finally goes away
08:10 gerardom: gm man
08:10 tmoney20g: missed you on friday
08:10 tmoney20g: got my trailstop for options working
08:11 tmoney20g: just have to get used to it
08:11 tmoney20g: don't know why i didn't enable that 6 months ago
08:11 gerardom: nice! im going to test once out today
08:12 saint: where do i find level  2
08:12 gerardom: did u get into any positions from friday?
08:12 AlphaInvestor: Tmoney - as I mentioned last week, if you are using Stops with options... Then you don't understand options!!!
08:12 Tom: Alright...show me how to get to TOS charts. TOS is now what I use...but the chart display is still called/labeled "Prophet."  How do I enable it?  Tech Support has NOT suggested that in any of my communications with them.
08:13 Tom: When you converted were there any deletions of your current information, at the time?
08:13 tmoney20g: went 4/4 on friday
08:13 AlphaInvestor: TOS charts are to the left of Prophet Charts on the menu
08:14 Tom: I'll start there, Alpha.
08:15 radon224: RIP SHLD....no surprise
08:15 tmoney20g: never even heard of "prophet" charts
08:20 AlphaInvestor: Don't get me wrong, I love Prophet Charts
08:21 Nube: Tom, click the charts tab. Those aren't he ToS charts. Click the Prophet tab and you get the Prophet charts.
08:21 Vimes: I should maybe give them a second look, just confusing that they have two charting engines on the same platform
08:22 AlphaInvestor: That's why one is going away
08:22 tmoney20g: if they are going away, why even bother
08:22 tmoney20g: looking like buyers at the open ?
08:23 Nube: Prophet had the advantage of being able to do ratio charts in the ticket box and it had a better pattern finder but those are the only two advantages I ever found it to have. Had more historic data which could be meaningful depending on the user but ToS has mucho historic data now too
08:23 tmoney20g: what's your take on the econ data Al ?
08:24 AlphaInvestor: Pattern Finder in Prophet is da bee's knees
08:26 Scott_OT: Only 1 out of three computers I have TOS on shows a prophet tab.
08:27 tmoney20g: 2 minutes
08:27 AlphaInvestor: Tmoney - must have sold lotsa cars to get the combination of numbers released this morning
08:28 esmal: good morning all
08:28 tmoney20g: i was interested in the internet retail
08:28 tmoney20g: up 1.1% i think they said
08:28 tmoney20g: but amazon gapped down a little at 830
08:29 tmoney20g: what you eyeing esmal ?
08:29 Nube: My take on econ data is that we should outlaw collecting it so there charlatans of monetary experiment can't use it as an excuse to monkey around
08:29 AlphaInvestor: Internet retailing... It's just a fad
08:52 HoBo: /
08:58 Vimes: Weekend update, I was digging into the Mobius volatility compression study (SqueezePivots), that was discussed in the chat last friday. I wanted to make it easier to review prior squeeze events on a historical chart, so I added some of the legacy points to the chart from the default study.  In addition, I was thinking it would be helpful to visualize the compressed trading range prior to the squeeze entry.  I used half this range to estimate a proposed risk value, which might be used against signals while "in the squeeze" range or upon squeeze exit... Finally, i thought it might be interesting to take the whole range while in the squeeze event to form the basis of a pivot projection to give a visual for potential risk off points or to better interpret the trading action after the squeeze exits, this is kept active until the next squeeze fires.  See the attached for a quick visual and the modified study.  I've placed all my code at the very bottom of the default study. Hopefully, this is additive to the original study, if anybody has any improvements or better coding skills to make it more useful/practical please feel free to modify.  Or if its complete garbage, well that's ok with me too.

10:21 MTS1: EAK; if you're talking about MarketWatch alerts PSAR uses recursive variables which are not allowed in MW Alerts. Chart alert function is the one Vimes mentioned which can easilly be added.
10:21 AlphaInvestor: Squeeze Bars ... now that is the kind of bar I can get my head around
10:23 Vimes: thanks mobius, will take a look later
10:23 Vimes: is there any merit to how i'm thinking about your oringal study?
10:23 Mobius: EAK - Since ParabolicSAR will scan you can setup MarketWatch alerts, email and SMS notices that way.
10:24 katherine1234: annyone know how to find EOY 2017 balance for IRA?
10:24 Mobius: Vimes - I've not been able to prove ANY statistical advantage or value to a squeeze. I keep looking though.  
10:26 Vimes: ok- i guess i'm confused then, why code the orignial squeeze study - do you not believe volatiliy compression is a valid heads up to trading?
10:27 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - it makes logical sense that Options IV should reduce while in the squeeze, then expand when the squeeze exits. Have you looke into that? If so, that would be tradable - buy options in the squeeze to sell them after it exits.
10:27 Mobius: lol   I've coded well over 10,000 studies. I find little of value in most of them.  I code because I can
10:29 EAK: Thank you Vimes and Mobius.  
10:29 EAK: and MTS1
10:30 Vimes: ok, visually to me this has some merit, maybe should try and simluate some backtest results
10:30 Mobius: Alpha.. If price squeezes and then drops IV will rise. But if price squeezes and then rises out of the squeeze IV will reduce. Without knowing which way price will breakout of the squeeze what can you sell or buy while price is in a squeeze that gives you any advantage??
10:31 Vimes: I guess it also gels with everything i've read back to dow theory, etc on periods of consolidatino, distibtuion, etc. to find the next period o f volatility expansion, so i'm not trying to challeng you more than clarify how you think about things
10:32 New_Trade: Hello smart scripters       Do you have a script to show small labels Advance and Decline value in left corner of my charts?  Would like to see it for futures /ES /NQ /GC ...and also for stocks   Thanks
10:32 AlphaInvestor: if price squeezes IV should drop, I agree that exiting the squeeze to the downside will cause a big IV rise. But exiting the squeeze to the upside could cause a minor uptick in IV ... since ATR and such went up.
10:32 Mobius: Alpha ... Prove that  :)
10:32 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - I was asking if YOU had tested that
10:33 EAK: so guys, i looked over that page, and it's foreign to me.  TD apparently won't code anything anymore.  They too told me this would be easy.  Is there ANY chance of someone coding that ParSAR alert PLEASE?
10:33 AlphaInvestor: I know logic and markets don't always go hand in hand  '-)
10:33 Mobius: I've tried and failed to find that very notion
10:35 Vimes: EAK, what alert on you exactly wanting and what did you not undrestand about the syntax of the alert functino
10:35 mthfr_vaxxed: you try looking during live markets or you use historical option chain stats to find it?
10:36 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - thanks, then I won't waste computer cycles, electrons, and precious brain cells on the search
10:36 EAK: vimes, just a simple alert to trigger when this indicator switches it's signal
10:37 DCR: Does ToS have the ability to tell what kind of options transaction took place on any given options trade.  Ie a Sweep, Tied to Stock, Spread, etc?
10:37 EAK: I don't understand much about coding.  I've tried my hand at it on and off since the intro of the PC.  I don't seem to have an aptitude for it.  
10:38 Vimes: DCR, only thing i know is the trade flash gadget
10:38 DCR: @Vimes, Thank you
10:39 Mobius: Alpha.. You may find what I couldn't.  What I found was that while in a squeeze if typical duration IV didn't do much at all. If a squeeze lasted a long time IV wold drop but not often far enough to profit from a strangle or straddle 
10:39 Mobius: Since you don't know which way price will breakout those seemed the only logical trade options to me
10:41 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - agreed in principal. But the location of prior support/resistance would enter into my decisions if doing manual trades
10:43 Mobius: Ok - What would be a scenario we could test?
10:45 Vimes: Well a squeeze to me means historical volatility is collapsing, which you are betting on a future volatily expansion?  Whether this is predictive of IV is perhaps another beast
10:47 harndog: Warning...always dangerous.... ariff on Mobius' trend line of squeeze...substitute ECI  and re-run. https://www.screencast.com/t/gW3UIkv4LfB
10:47 harndog: a riff
10:48 harndog: Note: In this script, I track the start of the Fractal Balance Point, and I call it (FBP).
10:48 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - sounds like you already tested it.
But - IV pre-squeeze - IV In the Squeeze - IV post-Squeeze - a) when squeeze exits up, b) when squeeze exits down. Sort these by Squeeze Lenght ... look for tradable patterns.
likely beyond the capability of TOS
10:49 harndog: Here is the script idea shown in the visual: http://tos.mx/EXcR0h#
10:51 harndog: I am heading out, unfortunately, but visually, tracking the FBP starts did a nice job tracking the market and how a trader should not fight a  "V" trend reversal.
10:53 Vimes:  
maybe similar view of same time frame?
10:53 Paris: New_Trade - Here is a color coded Advancers/Decliners Label I did a while back for the DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Feel free to make any adjustment as needed

10:54 New_Trade: Thank you Paris
10:55 Paris: yw
10:57 harndog: Vimes... Substituting the ECI and Mobius' flag version, "might" do a better job highlighting the expansion contraction market nature. Also, the Flag script has the ECI label measuring compression.
10:57 harndog: Again... all filtered through a padwan learner...:)
10:57 harndog: BBL
10:57 Vimes: ok will look further at your study
10:57 Vimes: thx for sahring
10:58 harndog: Thank you  and Mobius for sharing ...a riff on riff... all starting with a MObius idea.... lol
11:00 harndog: VImes,.. look at the screenshot first... the idea seems to track well, and that's why I shared it.

11:01 gary8329: In a watchlist,  is there a way to show the Week and Month opens?
11:08 EAK: Glad you guys are feeling the love.  Any way I can coax that knowledge to code my "simple alert" for ParSAR?  Thanks :)
11:11 Nube: There isn't anything to code, EAK. Just set up a scan for it and set an alert. viola.
11:11 MTS1: Gary; please clarify
11:11 MTS1: (Open whats?)
11:11 EAK: I will try that NUBE.  thx
11:18 gary8329: Week Open woud be at what price the stock opened at on the first day of the week.   Converserly, Month Open would be the opening price of the stock at the first day of the month. 
11:18 Double07trader: Hi all, anyone know if there is some setting to allow one to drag order prices on TOS chart, i can drag on demo account but not on live account (e.g. i want to move up a Stop Loss using mouse) ?
11:19 MTS1: Gary; just select open to be displayed and make sure you use the aggregations mentioned for each column
11:21 Vimes: gary, you would need to create two separete custom quotes one set for wekly aggreationg with something like
plot o = open;
and then do the exacty sme thing for the weekly
11:21 Vimes: er monthly
11:22 gary8329: I see.  Create a custom quote.

12:34 bkstrader: I need some help from a bubble expert. I have read the JohnnyQ
Educational material and tried a few tests but I can't get current
Variable values to show up in a bubble 8 bars away from current 
Bar. Any help would be greatly appreciated here is the code
input barsFromNow = 8;
def na = Double.NaN;
def bn = BarNumber();
def currentBar = HighestAll(if !IsNaN(close) then bn else na);
def currentDay = HighestAll(if   bn == currentBar then day else na); 
def hi = HighestAll(if bn == currentBar then high else na);
def lo = HighestAll(if bn == currentBar then low else na);
AddChartBubble(bn == CurrentBar + barsFromNow, lo, +KeyEvent + " Evt \n" 
+Round(ADX(),0) +" ADX\n" +Volume() +" Vol \n", Color.Light_Gray, 0);
All values are showing as N/A
12:41 MTS1: Is "day" defined?
12:41 Nube: !IsNaN(close[8]) and IsNaN(close[7])
12:42 Nube: bj, the values are showing na because there are no values in the expansion area.
12:42 MTS1: nor is keyevent defined?
12:44 MTS1: Start troubleshooting the location of hte bubble by just using "test" for the text; then add in the text syntax once the locatoin is correct? Text syntax can be tested with a label also.
12:44 Nube: Yeah, not sure what's up there. Either way he will have to make whatever value recursive and then Bob's his uncle
12:45 bkstrader: Nube I understand that . I tried to use (0)  and [bn] to define current value. That;'s the part I don't know how to do . Key event is a variable I defined. The bubble will show on the current bar but I don't know how to define it in the expansion area
12:45 bkstrader: MTS  The bubble shows where it is supposed to but the variable values show as n/A
12:46 MTS1: Then the bubble locatoin is not the issue? Seems like you're saying it is corect but not in the expansion area which is contradictory. Can't troubleshoot the variable values without the rest of the script if the only issue is the text displayed.
12:49 Nube: keyevent[8]
12:49 bkstrader: I tested the values in that snippet with a bubble on the current bar and they show up fine. I can't figure out how to reference the currnt value in the expansion area is that possible ?
12:49 TICKZ: bkstrader is that a adx studie?
12:50 Nube: Make keyevent recursive or index it back at least as many bars as you have moved the bubble forward.
12:50 bkstrader: Tickz I have the TOS Code for ADX in a larger script
12:51 TICKZ: just asking..i have a couple i picked up here..
12:51 TICKZ: was wondering if you need..
12:52 bkstrader: Nube I tried ADX [-8] and that didn't work  not sure what I need to do differently
12:52 TICKZ: http://tos.mx/vlwmX1# adx
12:52 TICKZ: http://tos.mx/jjW8aT# adx
12:52 TICKZ: http://tos.mx/6LkSkx# adx
12:53 bkstrader: Tick Thanks but ADX is not the problem its referenceing current bar in the expansion area
12:53 TICKZ: oh ok
12:54 TICKZ: http://tos.mx/3MrTfG# psar
12:55 JohnnyQuotron: bks... when you scripted the fool proof x axis addchart bubble did it paint in the proper place?
12:56 Nube: bk, that's 8 in the wrong direction.
12:56 Nube: That's 8 forward from where you have the bubble, you want 8 back.
12:58 bkstrader: JohnnyQ The scipt from the library works fine fine . I modified it with new lines and my variables theat's when I get the N/A
12:59 bkstrader: Nube If the bububble is 8 bars in expansion isn't current ADX [-8] from the bubble ?
13:00 JohnnyQuotron: minus sign is future.  Trust Nube.. Nube knows math
13:00 JohnnyQuotron: bks.if the bubble is in the future you need to access the value from the past
13:01 bkstrader: Tried ADX [8] still n/a
13:02 Nube: bk, how hard would it be to delete the minus sign and try it.
13:03 bkstrader: Just did Nube no luck
13:03 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current.
13:05 JohnnyQuotron: Question.. has anyone scripted a scan for the Gaussian Self Adjusting RSI Laguerre with FE?  I will try if not.
13:09 JohnnyQuotron: bks.  trouble shoot.. try a bubble with just the adx...  then try another with just the other variable data one by one  create debug labels for each bit of variable data you want in the bubble.  
13:09 Nube: bk, did you use the incorrect syntax that is in the post at :03?
13:09 JohnnyQuotron: Is the bubble in the proper xy location?
13:10 anees: hello , is there a way to get the floor pivot points, i get the pre programmed pivots and they arent accurate thanks
13:10 Nube: If you use the correct syntax and index the y value back the same distance you index the x value, you will have data
13:10 JohnnyQuotron: anees check mobius my trade or the community one note
13:11 anees: where is that

13:13 bkstrader: Thanks JohnnyQ, That's where I'm headed The bubble is in the right location. I was hoping with the skills in this room there might be quick. Time to roll up the sleeves tonight
13:13 bkstrader: Nube That gives me anothe direction to try
13:14 JohnnyQuotron: debug the variables one at a time in the bubble. Trust Nube
13:14 bkstrader: JQ I know , Nube has helped may times in the past
13:15 anees: i dont get what i am supposed to do here
13:15 anees: but thank you
13:15 JohnnyQuotron: anees
13:15 JohnnyQuotron: which method
13:15 JohnnyQuotron: which source
13:16 anees: i dont know all i know its called floor pivot points , i saw they were pretty accurate and wanted to ask if they are available for tos because i already have them on DAS
13:17 JohnnyQuotron: are you in the onenote?
13:17 JohnnyQuotron: are you in mobius mytrade?
13:17 anees: yeah
13:18 JohnnyQuotron: which
13:18 anees: one note
13:19 JohnnyQuotron: support resistance section?
13:19 anees: ok
13:20 anees: oh i see them
13:20 JohnnyQuotron: 2. Pivot Scripts... there are 30 of them  Floor Trader Pivots may be a place to start
13:21 anees: yeah im gonna try all of them
13:21 anees: thank you so much
13:21 JohnGalt82: Hi - Wondering if this is built in TOS or has been shared.  Looking to plot swing lines that cross back and forth over a moving average

13:34 sugar: johnnyquotron: it's ok you are already helping me out- so ithere a way?
13:35 Mobius: Johnny - There's an RSI Laguerre in MyTrade. The Gaussian version won't scan - Too Complex
13:35 Mobius: RSI Laguerre Scan in MyTrade
13:35 sugar: Mobius: can you send me the RSI Laguerre scan?
13:36 Mobius: no go get it from MyTrade
13:36 sugar: Mobius: where do you get mytrade?
13:37 sugar: Mobius: is that in think & swim?
13:37 Mobius: Right click ANY uers name and go the profile.
13:37 JohnnyQuotron: Mobius.. yes i have that and use it.  But with many etfs and S&P500 stocks i find the gaussian keeps me in the trade longer.    I'm a huge fan. Wonder if it will scan without the FE component?
13:37 Mobius: nope Johnny it will not
13:41 sugar: Mobius & Johnnyquontron: can I run a scan with donchain (ATRSX) with close?
13:43 JohnnyQuotron: mobius... bummer bummer bummer
13:47 Mobius: Johnny - This will scan.
Something in the scanner has changed since I wrote the original. It wouldn't scan then but I just checked and doesn now.
# RSI-Laguerre Self Adjusting With Fractal Energy Gaussian Price Filter

13:48 Mobius: The scan  reference was to the Study name and main plot crossing 0
13:48 Mobius: 8 returns on the S&P 500
13:49 Mobius: Well that would make a couple thousand TOS traders happy to know.
13:53 JohnnyQs_BackupWks: YOU THE MAN !
13:57 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current.  Thank you Mobius and thank you ToS for updating those scan servers. Wahoo...
13:58 bsinks: This has most likely been asked a bazillion times and if so I'm sorry..........Does any body have a link for a good HOD MOMO scanner for TOS
13:58 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - last time that was shared, it had Nfe of 8, Glenght of 13, BetaDev of 4. Now it is configured 5, 13, 8.
Any specific reason for the change. Symbol used on? aggregation period?
14:02 Mobius: Alpha... Just the way I used it last is all
14:02 chief: sugar, this should work as Donchian buy scan....
input length = 50;
plot buy = high > Highest(high[1], length);
14:04 AlphaInvestor: Thanks mobius - the shape and crossing times change of course - I think this is agreat study, one of the best you have done ... so always interested in how/why it works the way it does.
P.S. the math is beyond me
14:07 Mobius: Alpha.. The latest one I've been working on uses an error correction neuron to set the length for the gaussian filter and RSI time factor. Pretty cool.
14:07 AlphaInvestor: oooh, super cool
14:08 AlphaInvestor: I am short a few physical neurons, so software ones are always beneficial
14:08 Mobius: I'll post it when I'm sure it's working correctly
14:08 AlphaInvestor: Great, thanks!
14:08 AlphaInvestor: If yoiu need beta testers ...
14:08 Mobius: I'm sure the group will have a ball twisting and morphing it :)
14:09 bigworm: neuron?
14:09 AlphaInvestor: I rarely touch your studies, except to change the lipstick, or add debug statement so that I can understand how they work
14:10 Mobius: lol  go back to sleep big... 
14:10 ramesh2599: Is it possible to displaly dynamic vertical line  50 bars back?
14:10 AlphaInvestor: yes
14:11 AlphaInvestor: why, would be an appropriate question tho
14:12 MTS1: Ramesh; use barnumber() function and do the math to determine where 50 bars back is. Or index like IsNan(close)[-50]
14:13 Mobius: Quite a bit of /ES volume swapping hands today with no real movement.
14:13 ramesh2599: I am looking into its relationship with  RSI
14:13 Mobius: let me save you some time - There is no relationship with current RSI and RSI 50 bars back
14:14 MTS1: Ramesh; which relationship with RSI?
14:14 ramesh2599: ok
14:15 Mobius: Other than the Butterfly Effect
14:15 MTS1: But 48 bars may work;)
14:15 ramesh2599: 49 to be exact!
14:15 ramesh2599: Thank you all though!!
14:16 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - that is too simplistic - they will both be between 0 and 100
14:16 bigworm: lol i wasnt sleeping.  been up since 6!! had class today to learn about the kernel trick!!!
14:17 bigworm: seems very useful.  I have been looking at code on classifiers and it seems there are alot of ones that are iterative and you need lots of loops.  with kernels, it appears you only need to go over it once
14:17 bigworm: so computationaly, it appears much more effiecient and easy to swap out
14:17 Mobius: You turned left on your way to Walmart last night and because you didn't turn right an accident happened in Russia that killed the one person that could have saved the planet 40 years from now. But the one person that would save the planet 39 years from now was born because if the same turn you made last night.  True Story. 
14:18 bigworm: lol what?
14:19 Vimes: JD?
14:20 Vimes: i thinke he's illustrating the butterfly effect
14:20 bigworm: great movie
14:22 Mobius: String Theory, Chaos Theory, Quantum Entanglement - Spooky Action at a Distance, whatever everything is connected
14:22 bigworm: agree
14:24 Vimes: is it simlar to the kevin bacon theory
14:24 bigworm: mmm
14:24 AlphaInvestor: I know a guy named Kevin, and I like bacon
14:24 Mobius: ohhh bacon...yum
14:26 Mobius: Did you guys read about the kid that just proved that quantum computers are actually doing quantum stuff?
14:26 AlphaInvestor: bacon infused jack daniels - its a thng ... look it up
14:26 Vimes: i've had bacon in bloody mary's , <-_ not ashamed
14:27 bigworm: whats going on with your brain right now
14:27 Mobius: hmm a breakfast idea
14:27 bigworm: quantum bacon stuff?
14:27 mthfr_vaxxed: urmila mahadev?
14:27 Mobius: yep   grad student
14:27 bigworm: lol
14:27 Mobius: smart girl
14:27 Mobius: she will make a difference
14:28 Mobius: TOS needs to hire her  :)
14:28 bigworm: when will they be out?
14:28 bigworm: probably will be too expensive for me
14:29 Mobius: First Quantum Trading Platform.. You guys paying attention
14:29 Vimes: i think i'm in love
14:29 bigworm: im not quick enough to even use a regular computer that efficiently
14:30 AlphaInvestor: I am stuck on a continuous surface with only one side and only one boundary .. I have no time for such banal persuits
14:31 Mobius: I loved one of the illustrations used to describe a core problem with understanding what a quantum computer is doing. One with 100 qbits held in a single state would take a current harddrive the size of the visible universe to hold it's state data.  
14:33 Mobius: How could any human know if that data is correct??
14:34 mthfr_vaxxed: "Mahadev's protocl is unlikely to be implemented in a real quantum computer in the immediate future. For the time being, the protocol requires too much computing power to be practical."
14:34 Mobius: That young woman found a way... That is cool!
14:34 mthfr_vaxxed: sounds like an expensive "trust" function ....
14:35 Mobius: trust isn't an option
14:35 Mobius: Not unless you thing the Terminator would be a nice buddy
14:36 Mobius: think
14:38 NUG: Since TOS changed the futures symbols, I'm wondering if it is possible to use wildcards in thinkscript to compare with the results of the getSymbol() function??
14:38 Mobius: Why wonder. Use Addlabel and find out
14:38 Vimes: terminator 2, i think he was a nice buddy, been a while though
14:39 NUG: For example: current code is if getSymbol() == "/ES:XCME"
14:39 John1a: Does anyone have a script for the Std Channel in TOS that changes the channels color (green, yellow, red) depending on a trend, up, down, neutral. Thank you.
14:39 NUG: can I use if getSymbol() == "/ES*" ?
14:40 AlphaInvestor: Nug - you can use it, but I don't hink it will work any more
14:41 NUG: belly laugh
14:41 NUG: then why use it?
14:41 NUG: wish they'd leave shit alone
14:42 Vimes: i thought it was an exchange thing
14:42 bigworm: when did you stop teaching formally mobius
14:43 NUG: well, then they should code a routine to change the exchange requirements to the old TOS symbols so our code still works
14:50 NUG: Thanks anyway
14:56 AlphaInvestor: Nug - use   /ES:XCME   in your if statement
15:01 rupam: the RTD function for "/vxx18" does not work - any ideas?
15:01 rupam: i.e. RTD("tos.rtd",,"LAST","/VXX18") returns an error
15:02 Up_n_Up: put it on a watchlist and export it and stop futzing with the Excel side
15:02 rupam: hmm
15:03 AlphaInvestor: use      "/VXX18:XCBF"
15:05 rupam: aha! thanks...
15:09 Up_n_Up: watchlist columns that get exported somehow magically have the correct syntax, it's .... increeeedable...
15:09 chief: Never mind grad students and quantum computers. This is the headline that should get more attention  "New research suggests that climate change could trigger a global shortage of beer. " 
15:15 Taurean: Hey could somebody help me with a study as to when the Stochasitc RSI on the 5 minute chart goes above overbought or oversold and the Average line and the Value line are both greater than or less than the previous on the 30 minute chart please
15:18 Mobius: cheif - That is serious
15:20 Mobius: big.. I retired full time teaching 20 years ago. I had a grad student course up until 2 yrs ago and a couple students finishing last year.
15:20 Taurean: Hey Mobius could you give me a hand with my above statement if you dont mind?
15:21 Mobius: Taurean.. For a scan that can be done with the scan wizard easily.
15:21 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - how the heck old are you, are you in your 200's yet?
15:21 Mobius: lol  close
15:21 AlphaInvestor: retired 20 years ago, dats a long time ago
15:22 Mobius: Some of us don't wait till we're 70 to retire you know
15:23 AlphaInvestor: I dream of retiring that early
15:25 MTS1: @180???
15:25 Mobius: Alpha... There's this little thing called trading. Try that and you'll never go to an office again.  :)
15:26 AlphaInvestor: never heard tell of that kinda thing ... how would one learn how to do that?
15:27 Up_n_Up: somebody told me it was hard once
15:28 Mobius: We've traded two inside days since the "Big Red One". How often does that happen and what typically happens next?
15:29 Up_n_Up: sounds like today's pop quiz
15:35 AlphaInvestor: I would bet that the 3rd day after Big Red is not an inside day
15:35 AlphaInvestor: BUT, if I knew the answer, I might just become a trader
15:37 Taurean: Im going to put this on the 5 minute chart...can someone tell me where i went wrong?
15:38 Taurean: StochRSI("rsi length" = 10, "k period" = 10, "slowing period" = 3, "average type" = "EXPONENTIAL")."FullK" crosses below StochRSI("rsi length" = 10, "k period" = 10, "slowing period" = 3, "average type" = "EXPONENTIAL")."OverSold"
MACDTwoLines(aggregationPeriod.THIRTY_MIN)."Value" is greater than MACDTwoLines(aggregationPeriod.THIRTY_MIN)."Value" from 1 bars ago and MACDTwoLines(aggregationPeriod.THIRTY_MIN)."Avg" is greater than MACDTwoLines(aggregationPeriod.THIRTY_MIN)."Avg" from 1 bars ago
15:39 New_Trade: Mobius plese, please open teaching trading room
15:42 AlphaInvestor: Taurean - split that into 2 or more separate conditions, then use
plot Scan = cond1 and cond2 and cond3'
15:42 New_Trade: 2 inside days and VIX = 21.30....
15:42 chief: There is a small pennant on the spy which is usually a continuation pattern. Break to the downside suggests 257 spy
15:43 Nube: I support Mobius having a teaching room but only open by invite to those with the sufficient foundation and desire as determined by the Selection Committee of One.
15:45 AlphaInvestor: Nube - do you chair the SCoO?
15:45 New_Trade: but  scripting is not mandatory...   LOL
15:45 novapawshere: I cant get an alert that occurs when one moving average crosses anohter moving average to work? can someone help me figure out why this may be?
15:45 amalia: 5/29,5/30&5/31 was last InsideBar
15:46 Up_n_Up: ok ,and then what happened?
15:46 amalia: The bottoming happened and we shot up.
15:47 amalia: 4.91% up before we formed a top
15:48 AlphaInvestor: Amalia - i'm game
15:48 Nube: M does.
15:48 novapawshere: anyone willing to hlep?
15:49 AlphaInvestor: Nova - Chart Alert, Marketwatch Alert, or Dynamic Watchlist Alert?
15:49 Nube: Don't get me wrong, I'm glad we don't have that - I'd have never learned to script.
15:49 novapawshere: marketwatch alert
15:49 AlphaInvestor: so for a single symbol
15:50 novapawshere: Like i do if this moving average of 5 periods crosses this moving average of 9 periods alert me. Activates but never alerts when they do cross
15:50 novapawshere: also i do alert if 'true'
15:51 New_Trade: amalia  on 5/29 - 5/31 /ES was above 50 MA and now we below 200 MA
15:52 novapawshere: I feel like it must have something to do with the chart timeframes because  moving averages are different if your looking at a 5m vs 15m but there is no way to select one within alert options as far as i can tell
15:52 slashgw: there should be the option
15:53 novapawshere: where?
15:53 slashgw: when creating the alert
15:53 novapawshere: how confident are you in that?
15:54 slashgw: https://screencast.com/t/R5h1wzt6
15:54 novapawshere: ahh
15:55 novapawshere: i just cant find it in the options though
15:55 novapawshere: wait
15:55 slashgw: https://screencast.com/t/QewgbCq9yeo8
15:55 novapawshere: the live support guy just found it for me
15:55 AlphaInvestor: So, do you have a Study Alert something lke this:
MovingAvgCrossover(length1 = 5, length2 = 9, "crossing type" = "below")
15:55 novapawshere: yeah
15:56 novapawshere: sweet i think that will fix it
15:56 slashgw: cool. goodluck
15:56 novapawshere: thankss slashgw and alphainvester
15:56 novapawshere: you guys rock
15:56 amalia: yw
15:57 AlphaInvestor: Another satisfied ThinkScript Lounge customer
16:21 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current.  Time to heat up a few ToS Scan Farm CPUs.
16:24 JohnnyQuotron: bks.. did your bubble issue get resolved?
16:26 FrankB3:  Would someone color the background of the chart:  when the pink line is over the blue>> green,  and when th blue line is over the  pink >> red,, thanks      http://tos.mx/Thr0JJ#
16:28 Nube: AssignBackgroundColor ()
16:29 FrankB3:   Do I have to first marry the two scripts to normalize them ??
16:33 Nube: If they aren't on the same script, yes.
16:37 FrankB3:   Really not a good idea,,, thanks any way....  Mr. Mo's  script close enough for ship yard work::      http://tos.mx/CeOe8E#
16:41 DSF_TX: Could someone help me with a script for a scan .  I want to scan for the 8 ema to be above the 34 ema for 21 days or more.
16:41 DSF_TX: I was able to write the script without the timeframe.  but want to add the 21 day timeframe.
16:42 AlphaInvestor: Combining a Momentum indicator .. and a Choppiness indicator, and looking for where they cross ... hmmm
16:42 AlphaInvestor: share what you have
16:43 FrankB3: Yep,, its called RSI Lagear
16:44 FrankB3:   already been done by Mr. Mo
16:45 AlphaInvestor: Frank - good point
16:45 AlphaInvestor: I don't know that the crossover is a signal tho
16:45 DSF_TX: http://tos.mx/bbxr7t#
16:46 Vimes: def ema8 = expAverage(close,8);
def ema34 = expAverage(close,34);
plot scan = sum(ema8>ema34,21)>=21;
16:47 AlphaInvestor: showoff
16:47 Vimes: me? never
16:47 Vimes: that has about a 50% chance of working
16:48 Nube: The swing from 0 to 1 or visa versa on the LG RSI is fast enough that often it will cross .5 and OB or OS on the same bar so it's likely not a bad cross to take as a signal.
16:48 Nube: Not because the cross itself is special, but the speed makes most crosses about the same
16:49 Donnie: Do they have a screener for the mobile app? Or just the pc
16:50 Vimes: Not sure on the screener part, but i know you can save a screen based watchlist and access it via mobile
16:51 AlphaInvestor: Nube - I configure mine to cross slower ... more of an oscillator, not a yes/no signal
16:51 Nube: Ah, then that would be a different beast
16:52 AlphaInvestor: I know that Mobius likes it to be more of a signal ... because he uses it for program trading
16:53 AlphaInvestor: I prefer the gray area ... when used as an oscillator
16:54 amalia: Donnie, the built in one are pretty good and accessible on mobile. If you prefer a custom one, create one on desktop, save it under a name then you can access the screener on mobile.
16:55 amalia: *ones
17:02 Nube: There's for sure a legitimate reason to want an indication to be an on / off switch. I make my final trade decisions based on a couple of yes or no criteria so it's clear cut. But screening before I get to the yes or no stage is entirely different matter, and one I do not want switch type indicators for.
17:06 TICKZ: Im trying to make a grid to look at the global markets..but I can't find the tickers.. Can Anyone help me plz? or any Ideas?
17:13 chief: tickz...just do a googl search on country etfs
17:14 TICKZ: ok. thanks
17:15 slashgw: also look at cme futures
17:15 TICKZ: like? /6a/6b/6e etc ?
17:15 Nube: Tickz, check out the ishares website. They have ETFs for most counties in the EAFE and the EEM
17:15 slashgw: sure, currencies as well as /NKD and I'm sure there are others
17:16 slashgw: checkout their website to see what all is available
17:16 Nube: ewt, Eden, qat etc etc
17:16 TICKZ: Ok. Thanks guys!
17:25 amalia: Just trade MinRange on /YM.
17:25 mthfr_vaxxed: amalia : did you prepare?
17:26 mthfr_vaxxed: i think your one of the few who listens to my crazy anticts
17:28 amalia: =)
17:30 hguru: How do you scan on the mobile app what am o missing ?
17:32 amalia: I listen to contributors. My leaning towards shortcuts in tS comes from BLT/Mobius, long term books are similar to AlphaInvestor, my daytrading is similar to Mobius’ ORB, my curiosity behind the veil in studies from Nube, etc.
17:33 Nube: Save a scan on desktop and it will be a watchlist on mobile
17:34 hguru: Hum ok I have a bunch of watch lists
17:35 hguru: Your talking scan results becomes a watchlist I get that
17:43 MTS1: Save it as a query and it becomes a 'live' scan / watchlist that updates in mobile.
17:43 MTS1: (Don't just save the output as a watchlist)
17:44 MTS1: Those dynamic watchlists / queries have a pink symbol in front of them on desktop.
17:46 MTS1: (OR green; believe those are option hacker scans)
17:58 hguru: Hum ok thx
18:03 inov: hello..i am writing a simple study alert like below and when I receive the Alert msg, I dont get the text "SimMovAvg_Greater", instead a portion of the code is shown, can one of you help
18:03 inov: def agg = AggregationPeriod.DAY;
plot cPrice = close(period = agg);
plot savg = close > simpleMovingAvg(cPrice,20);
Alert (savg, "SimMovAvg_Greater");
18:08 TICKZ: Nube.. im using your "LABLE" script to add the countrys name.. i change the studie name..but it keeps changing other lables... can you help me plz?
18:09 TICKZ:  
18:10 Up_n_Up: inov, if the syntax is right, contact support and tell them Alert is broken
18:10 TICKZ:  
18:11 Up_n_Up: I guess the obvious question is how did you change it?
18:12 amalia: Buy /YM
18:13 TICKZ: i changed the script name for each country.. thinking it will stp changing other countrys name..
18:14 Up_n_Up: the name of the script has nothing to do with what gets displayed
18:14 Up_n_Up: lounge rule #12 - you can't have your own syntax
18:14 TICKZ:  
18:15 Up_n_Up: that will ALWAYS display Saudi Arabia, no matter what the chart, but then you know that by now
18:15 TICKZ: hah yeah
18:17 Up_n_Up: the one means always display the text string
18:18 slashgw: should be able to take a vote on the syntax one
18:18 TICKZ: I gtg... Thanks
18:18 Up_n_Up: lol slash
18:22 DMonkey: tickz....you will need to use getsymbol() aand use an if then statement....
18:25 Up_n_Up: well not really right  addlbl(getsym()=="whatever", "whatevertxt");
18:26 Up_n_Up: so much fun to make up your own syntax....   :)
18:28 amalia: lol Wish it worked like that.
19:37 John1a: Is there a way to change the color of the columns in the price ladder DOM? I've screen shots with different colors for Bis Size column and other columns, but I cannot find a setting for it. Or is it no longer an option in the current version?
19:45 DMonkey: example....this is one way to accomplish.....you pick your symbols & what you want the text to display.....
addlabel(1,if getsymbol() == "SPY" then "SPY" else if getsymbol() == "XOM" then "Exxon Mobile" else "" + getsymbol());
19:48 admin_tculs: thinkScript Lounge chatroom will be closing soon   Please finish all conversations by 8pm ct   Have a nice evening
19:50 DMonkey: gn
