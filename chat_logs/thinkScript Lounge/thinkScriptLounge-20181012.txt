16:31 Anonymous so far: What do y&aposall think about SQ tomorrow? Down?
16:31 VolCrush: *histograms
16:31 JC_chart: i do actually sometimes but not in that image
16:31 VolCrush: i tink SQ has lost all or most of their top shelf managers, apparently der CEO is an arse
16:32 JC_chart: in that image I am showing two different histograms one driven on breadth and volume and one driven on price
16:32 VolCrush: wats the delta rthen from one histo to the other?
16:32 VolCrush: ah ok
16:32 JC_chart: the move
16:32 JC_chart: or momentum
16:33 JC_chart: but here let me do a fib one so you dont think i am bsing you one sec
16:33 VolCrush: momentum in volume? volume and breadth?
16:33 VolCrush: btw, you should be able to post the chart directly in here 
16:33 JC_chart: yes as a raw input that is transformed by the indicator
16:38 JC_chart: this is one of the GC trades i did
16:38 JC_chart: i tried to post it right in here but gave me a bad size
16:39 JC_chart: the entry was at one fib and exit at another
16:39 VolCrush: got it, thanks
16:40 JC_chart: my sq chart says it is flat lined in a range so hard to tell what will happen tomorrow
16:40 admin_tculs: JC  please do not post outside links here
16:41 JC_chart: well how do you post an image in her admin_TCULS
16:41 VolCrush: s/he is tryin to post the TOS chart in here, but I and others don't know how to do that
16:44 AlphaInvestor: JC - make your chart smaller before clippping - I use WinDoze 10 Snipping Tool. Then past into the chat box, right click and Zoom to 10%. Then hit send
16:45 VolCrush: ty, Alpha
16:45 JC_chart: how small
16:45 VolCrush: 10%
16:45 Gus: can't wait until eveything can be shorted with ease
16:46 AlphaInvestor: 640 x 640 I believe, but not sure
16:46 VolCrush: LOL, shorting for the last 3 days has been as easy as it gets
16:47 Gus: anybody a strictly short saler here?
16:47 VolCrush: or what, Alpha said
16:47 JC_chart: k
16:48 Gus: also yeah, but the consistency of being able to short all the time so not just 3 days lol
16:48 JC_chart: been able to short gold for a long time LOL
16:49 Gus: yes yes for sure but easier lol, i guess I'm not on the JC_chart level yet haha
16:49 AlphaInvestor: Gus - you can short most liquid things, those that are NTB or HTB, you can often go Synthetic Short via options
16:50 AlphaInvestor: Sell an ATM call, buy an ATM put - viola ... you are synthetic short stock
16:50 Gus: only have 18k and ive shorted $SUPV $MDXG $INNT & $BFR easy plays but as i get better I don't want to implode from lok
16:50 AlphaInvestor: I have a couple Call Credit Spreads on BFR -- bearish play
16:51 Gus: yeah i got out of it awhile back but thinking of heading back in soon
16:51 VolCrush: i tink he a penny scalper
16:52 Gus: not all the time haha but percentages are huge on plays like that
16:52 Gus: bfr went down like 15% in the last week, i shorted $SUPV instead and got 7% before it reversed and now its down another 7% since i left
16:53 AlphaInvestor: Vol - ah, CCS too commish intensive for penny scalping
16:53 AlphaInvestor: SUPV doesn't trade options, I cannot be short in my IRA
16:53 Gus: h&s pattern with a terrible downtrend on those stocks is a consistent play that I've made but don't wait long enough to realize
16:53 Gus: the best gainz
16:54 Gus: also, laugh if you'd like, ive never touched options haha
16:55 Gus: just basic shorting and longing, mostly shorting, as im better at that.
16:58 JC_chart: wow TOS sure does make it hard for you
16:58 VolCrush: chit bronx, AH moves e.g. AMZN*
16:59 JC_chart:  
16:59 JC_chart: OMG did that work
16:59 JC_chart: so vol that was an NVDA trade i took
17:00 JC_chart: entered when histos and trend line were green at the bottom of the range fib and exited at the 23.6
17:01 VolCrush: DAMN u did it, way to persevere
17:01 JC_chart: i am not sure if that was more frustrating or when the time and sales stopped today on gc LOL
17:07 AlphaInvestor: you missed the part about right clicking and scaling down to 10%
17:08 AlphaInvestor: That way you can post a slightly bigger chart, scaled down so it doesn't burn so much buffer
17:08 RandomDan: I am back.
17:09 AlphaInvestor: whew
17:10 RandomDan: I see I shouldn't have sold BABA
17:11 408Spartan: Any idea how to enable After Hours/ Pre Market prices for the tickers in MarketWatch?
17:12 JC_chart: I am not sure how to scale it down on my mac actually
17:13 VolCrush: i hope someon jotted down der num bronx called out, cuz we might hit and she's sending us pics................just sayin'

17:23 VET tryng to make money : Thank you
17:23 VET tryng to make money : Thanks

17:28 AlphaInvestor: how many INTC chips are in that mobile you are posing from?
17:28 blondetrader: jpm b4 bell?
17:28 chenmannmobile: no idea but with all the talk about chinese spy chips maybe we should stay with intel chip no?
17:28 chenmannmobile: yes bt
17:29 chenmannmobile: if good , up we go
17:30 AlphaInvestor: BT - yes, I posted the banks that are reporting earlier
17:30 chenmannmobile: nflx er 16th al
17:31 NullTrader: Hi I have a study that was created by my own code. I was able to edit it before. Now when I right click it, it only shows a "calculator" but no code to edit. What did I do wrong?

17:31 blondetrader: well fingers crossed
17:31 blondetrader: from these prices the long would be so much more awesome
17:34 408Spartan: JC_chart can you post a s creenshot of what youre seeing? I couldnt find it.
17:36 JC_chart: what im seeing  for what?
17:36 408Spartan: the Setting youre talking bout
17:36 VolCrush: meh, meh
17:37 RandomDan: gap up tomorrow becoming more plausible
17:37 chenmannmobile: buy baba back dan
17:37 chenmannmobile: ah
17:37 408Spartan: Apparently you cant or so says Support "Hello! Sorry about the wait. Afterhours prices you will look at the bid and ask."
17:38 VolCrush: pics from bronx, becoming a 98% probibility with IV of 2%
17:38 AlphaInvestor: 408 - wrong!!
17:38 AlphaInvestor: But support don't know diddly some times
17:38 JC_chart: im short gc at 1227
17:38 amalia: Buy /YM
17:38 RandomDan: too late, sold at 141.90
17:39 RandomDan: I am not buying back at a loss
17:39 JC_chart: target is 1226. but might not get there on 1st try
17:39 408Spartan: AlphaInvestor thats what I thought i mean its a pretty simple utility just goddamn hard to find tht Setting
17:39 AlphaInvestor: 408 - add a new custom column - I named mine myLast ... put a single word inside    CLOSE   ... set the aggregation to 1 minute using the little box that defaults to D (daily)
17:39 RandomDan: I am long plenty of other stuff
17:40 amalia: 61 t trail
17:41 blondetrader: gc drop to 20
17:41 JC_chart: 404spart do you see the gear in your tooldbar header a
17:41 JC_chart: haha
17:41 AlphaInvestor:  
17:41 JC_chart: im hoping that for you with rty
17:41 blondetrader: and tomorrow if below that 1213
17:41 RandomDan: JC I think you will make money short gc
17:41 AlphaInvestor: 408 - also, make sure you click the box for EXT hours
17:42 AlphaInvestor: right click that post, zoom up to 100%
17:42 blondetrader: will prob do gc short tomorrow
17:42 amalia: P shape from 24,893
17:42 amalia: Intraday
17:43 VolCrush: i noticed the move in /gc today, kinda scratched myself but the $$$$ did dip a bit; inflation worries all over
17:43 JC_chart: I dont know  gc hit 126.6 5 times now  and my chart is now  has conflict
17:43 VolCrush: listening to the Grateful Dead eating pistachio ice cream
who, who has it better than us?
17:44 AlphaInvestor: NOBODY
17:44 JC_chart: i think it was the shorts covering after  the hbid up last night and early this morning and some hedging too
17:45 RandomDan: gc was just a fear play IMHO, fear be dissipating. It's not a good inflation hedge even if inflation actually became a thingm
17:45 AlphaInvestor: Timberland is a great inflation hedge! And I know just the guy ...
17:45 JC_chart: dont disagree but the market players become irrational on days like to day so....
17:46 RandomDan: yeah but if the market rises tomorrow, gc goes back to sleep
17:47 JC_chart: ya know GC has always a few great day trades every day
17:47 RandomDan: I don't really follow it. It's just on my watchlist for context.
17:48 JC_chart: and if youre right, it will march back to 1165 or so and that could be a good bit of trading to there
17:48 JC_chart: i like trading cl too but sometimes it is just too   whiphot and wicky candles so i trade gc
17:49 AlphaInvestor: Well, it was real today. Later Traders
17:49 JC_chart: I dont like es as i it is expensive and actually doesnt have that many great moves except when a plunge happens
17:49 RandomDan: No idea. I think it's going to hang around 1200, but no reasoning behind that.
17:49 chenmannmobile: later al
17:49 RandomDan: later Al
17:49 VolCrush: /cl is the most news driven product out there, to trade /cl you must follow the news on /cl and global macros
17:50 RandomDan: the mood in the room is different tonight. yesterday most of us were shell shocked
17:50 JC_chart: I just follow my chart for cl
17:50 JC_chart: when things agree and there is a fib range go in
17:50 JC_chart: there are usually 10 or so trades a day on the 3m
17:51 RandomDan: cl... I have no edge at all. Would never try it.
17:51 JC_chart: my charts have the edge
17:51 RandomDan: I don't know how many tankers are parked wherever... how many rigs this and that.
17:52 JC_chart: don't really give a you know what ... my chart indicators agree there i is a trade i take it as i beleive in my charts
17:53 JC_chart: not saying that with any obnoxiousness just saying that is the truth
17:53 chenmannmobile: i only trade cl during war
17:53 chenmannmobile: any war
17:53 RandomDan: Whatever works for you man.
17:53 JC_chart: i lost a lot of money  disagreeing with my chart and not beleiveing in my system ... once i paid attention and trusted my system its been great
17:53 RandomDan: war, charts, loaded dice
17:55 chenmannmobile: cnbc special, was today s flush the bottom?
17:55 RandomDan: 
17:56 blondetrader: ugh
17:57 RandomDan: my sense, and take it for what its worth, is tomorrow is big bounce #1, but I have no idea if it will hold (or even happen, just the voice in my head)
17:58 chenmannmobile: did fill that gap es 2713, and bounced right off
17:58 RandomDan: Also, while I am playing a clairvoyant trader on TV, I would look for GOOG close to 1120
17:59 RandomDan: 1115 maybe. Something like that.
18:00 VolCrush: welp, if CNBS said that, we have 500 points more to the downside   
18:00 RandomDan: Of course ERs could be awful and the whole house of cards goes to the floor.
18:00 VolCrush: or short the gap up, LOL
18:00 RandomDan: What are those fine folks saying?
18:01 VolCrush: or read the *ucking tape
18:01 chenmannmobile: "it s time to nibble" cramer
18:01 VolCrush: i would never much less take a bite out of Cramer
18:01 VolCrush: *I would never nibble...
18:01 RandomDan: Cramer would be good if he didn't push his book so much.
18:01 VolCrush: really is he tasty
18:02 VolCrush: ??
18:02 RandomDan: I like the guy. It's like having an uncle who's a used car salesman.
18:03 VolCrush: you shouldn't refer to Marcos that way
18:04 RandomDan: I wouldn't buy a car from him but I like the stories.
18:05 chenmannmobile: o wow futures up lot....so far
18:06 blondetrader: shhh
18:06 blondetrader: they will hear u

18:31 tmoney20g: so in reality, it'll dip 1000 pts since i think its going to go up
18:31 tmoney20g: amzn trying to hit 1760 before ah closes
18:32 amalia: Hoping polarity stays positive
18:32 tmoney20g: so that's almost 100 pts since 3pm
18:36 amalia: Yep. #TeamWideStops ftw
18:36 amalia: And for the losses. haha
18:40 EasyE: I just need SPY to open at 288 and I'll be done.
18:40 tmoney20g: ok, gonna play games now

18:59 RandomDan: Well, we'll always have NIO.
19:00 AlphaInvestor: Chen - I was 8.2% cash last week, but put some to work in some quality names over the past 2 days
19:01 chenmannmobile: nice
19:01 chenmannmobile: we r up so much, i m tempted to take some profits
19:01 chenmannmobile: but no will wait for tomorrow ....
19:03 RandomDan: don't know what to tell you
19:03 RandomDan: fins could put a monkey wrench into our plans
19:04 RandomDan: too late now anyway

19:04 chenmannmobile: spy 24 hrs dan
19:04 amalia: /YM >327 will take us to 427

14:11 Vimes: i guess it won'at capture screenshots
14:11 mthfr_vaxxed: negative. text only
14:12 Vimes: still very nice, smart work
14:12 mthfr_vaxxed: im missing a lot of days and wanna get all the good stuff while im gone
14:13 mthfr_vaxxed: if you know git... feel free to pull request
14:16 MTS1: MTH; I see you have the PY exe in there also; but not sure how it works, if anything else is needed or how to set it up; if you are up for a how-to doc that'd be great also.
14:16 mthfr_vaxxed: only works on linux
14:17 MTS1: Ah. .
14:17 MTS1: hell of a bounce was it Mo that we needed?
14:18 mthfr_vaxxed: but you shouldn't need to run it. if you want it locally on your computer... learn git. after repo is cloned you just `git pull` for latest
14:19 Nube: Yowsers this the best bounce we've had all week. I think that Mobius fellow might know a thing or two.
14:23 mthfr_vaxxed: rgrep -E 'Mobius|AlphaInvestor|VolCrush' chat_logs/
14:29 FrankB3: Thanks Mr. Mo: for # Typical Price Reversal Strategy,, works good
14:29 Vimes: i agree
14:30 Mobius: yw.. When volatility is over 20 studies like that do well
14:31 FrankB3:   Trying to work in with any RonCo strategy
14:33 Mobius: I just use it for intraday futures trading. RonCo is more for options. Guess you could intraday trade futures options with it
14:34 John1a: What is a RonCo strategy?
14:34 FrankB3:   No longer looking for homeruns: will settle for 1 -3% for 4-5 days... ha, now that you said IV :  do see a lot of  $1 -$2 moves interday in stocks
14:38 Mobius: John - an options strategy. Set it an forget it. $1.00 wide In/Out spread.  Risk 1 to make 1 sort of thing. 
14:40 John1a: Mobius: Thank you, so which zones study do you use, it seems there is more than one version/variety.
14:41 Mobius: John.  What I use depends on what it is I want to see.  There's no such thing as one study fits all
14:41 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - I updated the spreadsheet In/Out tool that DK's team built to pull the bid/ask stuff using RTD and sent it back to him
14:42 Mobius: That by the way IS the Holy Grail. Every Study has it's use and knowing that use it the Grail
14:43 Mobius: Alpha.. What's the weather over there looking like?
14:43 AlphaInvestor: The Grail according to AlphaInvestor:
The Grail - a) a set of no more than a dozen carefully selected Technical Analysis indicators that you know backwards forwards and upside down b) a Trading Plan and the discipline to follow your plan, c) a thorough understanding of fundamentals and Fundamental Analysis, d) a curious mind and a commitment to lifetime learning, e) a capacity for and love of work ... Hard Work, and f) patience when needed, the ability to react quickly when required, and the wisdom to know when each is appropriate.
14:44 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - TS Michael was much worse than I expected here, lots of rain, high winds, power outages. It has blown thru already into NC.
14:45 AlphaInvestor: Nothing like Florida tho .. Prayers!
14:45 UpTheCreek: can't you put that in a pill or something?
14:45 Mobius: Glad your safe
14:45 Mobius: It already comes in a bottle UPC
14:48 UpTheCreek: kinda brownish stuff I imagine...
14:49 John1a: Mobius: I mean which study shows quaterly balance zones.
15:17 teebone: Mobius ive been seeing some of your old stuff all over the internet
15:19 Vimes: legen....wait for it....dary.  Legendary!
15:35 Nube: Vimes + 1
16:00 FrankB3: Mr. Mo> never done a "in-out spread",  did a few 2 day credit spread::  Would it be feasible to do a 1 -2 day in-out spread ?????
16:02 inov: we're there problems with Study Alerts today after 10:00 a.m
16:03 FrankB3:   Would be hard to get options fill??   Got my prices on credit spreads or I did not play
16:04 FrankB3:   I know thats not the way dk teaches
16:07 Nube: Frank, if I was only going to be in for a day or two, I wouldn't do a spread
16:09 FrankB3: you are most right
16:10 FrankB3:   But I like the idea of risking one to make one
16:10 FrankB3:    sort of like a roullette bet
16:10 AlphaInvestor: I hate the idea of risk one to make one ... no edge
16:11 FrankB3: for 1 day ??
16:11 Nube: I like risking 1 to make a multiple of 1, but if the strategy has an advantage then 1 to 1 is a money maker
16:12 FrankB3:   AI::  just think you double your IRA ten time in 10 days
16:13 AlphaInvestor: yeah, right
16:13 FrankB3:   :(
16:13 inov: Did anyone have issues with Study Alerts today
16:14 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current
16:14 amalia: inov, email support@thinkorswim.com
16:14 inov: tx amalia
16:18 MTS1: Ofcourse there can be edge in risking one to make one; the spreads they're talking about when I've seen them can have quite a variance in IV = edge, different delta (lose slower on the one you own than the one you sell) = edge, and they are directional; so the entry signal you use can be statistically based and give you edge? But the RR Should probably be updated: If your rule is to always close out at x profit (not max profit) than it's risking 1 to make x. .
16:19 FrankB3: thanks MTS
16:20 MTS1: inov; there are different types of study alerts; helps to be specific when you ask.
16:20 FrankB3:     I hope I'm wrong about this study:  don't look good:      http://tos.mx/Ejq5He# 
16:20 AlphaInvestor: MTS - the only way they make sense to me is with a strong directional play
16:21 MTS1: DK also plays them specifically at extremes; still directional with higher chances / edge for reversal to mean.
16:22 MTS1: Frank; not sure what you're looking at in that grid or what pecifically is not good to your eyes.
16:23 FrankB3:   weekly and monthly breaking the moving averages.....  tested over long periods of time
16:23 MTS1: (PSA; only one shared study in grid ;))
16:23 AlphaInvestor: thks MTS
16:23 FrankB3: ahhh
16:24 FrankB3:   http://tos.mx/AUh1uT# 
16:26 MTS1: It doesn't tell me much Frank, besides that we're still in a LT upgrend and we're having a regular pullback to MA. But maybe I'm miss-interpreting.
16:26 MTS1: Is there something different about the secdond share?
16:28 FrankB3:    Study was done by trader who tries to say when to get out of market for long term holders ???
16:29 willliam1970: have been attempting  geta a 5min chart ema and sma on a 1 min and 24 tick chart is there a script that i can use that will allow this,  5min  100  50  sma and 20 and 10 ema
16:31 amalia: Time based studies don’t work with tick charts.
16:32 willliam1970: can this be done on a one minute chart
16:32 amalia: It can.
16:32 MTS1: Which study frank, the top dog stochastic on a monthly? I'm not seeing it though; not even to the prior extremes where they'd turn around. But not my chart so does not 'speak' to me I guess.
16:34 UpTheCreek: william as an example the dailySMA study can accept other aggs as an input
16:36 MTS1: William; for an SMA for sure and I believe for an EMA also you can simply multiply the lenght by the factor you're looking for? A 200 SMA on a daily is the same as a 40 SMA weekly; same on your minute charts.
16:37 FrankB3: MTS:  the full stoch. and DMI was my idea to test out the idea of P3_squeeze would be better on a monthly chart for buying  targets.   You only see a TTM_Squeeze on a monthly chart, about once in 4 years... trying to hack JC's ideas
16:43 MTS1: OK; that's not on the chart you shared I think so not looking at the same thing. The DMI is too messy to me; tried to understand in the past but does not do it for me yet, and the stoch did not jump out with a message to me.
16:45 AlphaInvestor: William - well, isnt a 5 minute 20 EMA very similar to a 1 minute 100 EMA?
16:46 JohnnyQuotron: Alpha... just catching up.  Had some weather today?  Pleased that you and yours are well.
16:47 AlphaInvestor: Not a lot of effects, but definitely more than I expected being so far from the FL panhandle
16:47 Vimes: Feels like Michael had a bigger impact than forecasted
16:52 FrankB3: MTS:  are you a fan of the "p3-Squeeze ?
16:54 FrankB3:    I don't think too many traders care about it:  work done by an outsider, wendy kirkland
16:56 UpTheCreek: most of the studies in TOS are the work of outsiders, some directly acknowledged, most not.
16:57 FrankB3:  by outsider I mean not from wall street,,  same thing ??
16:57 Nube: MTS, regarding the risk to reward of the 1 to 1. You're correct in that most talk about taking the trade off at x percent of possible profit. As I understand the intent of the strategy is explicitly to not do that and just let it go to expiration
17:04 FrankB3:   I think this was her orignial idea,,  before I hacked it up for shorter trades.  The idea is buy only targets: when the ADX reaches up and retraces, and the same time when the MACD drops and retraces..  IE on 5/3 and 6/29 would be buy points.  She woud buy otions 3 months out.      http://tos.mx/CCvOqz#
17:06 FrankB3:   I never thought to test it in a down market
17:08 FrankB3: one down fall, I'm still working on how to get by double bottoms that are close
17:20 AlphaInvestor: Vimes - ears on?
17:22 Vimes: yep, i'm here
17:24 AlphaInvestor: Vimes a study you recently posted says we should now be 0*TLT and 1*SPY -- how much do you trust that study?
17:25 Vimes: i don't have any history with it other than i head read the article from grossmann website and was curious about it
17:25 AlphaInvestor: Gotcha - thanks
17:26 Vimes: i have a hard time buying tlt right now, so don't disagree with that allocation, however when i go back and look at the allocations in his model i don't get a good match
17:27 AlphaInvestor: I like the max drawdown reduction, about half
17:27 barry314: Thank you everyone for your script help Tuesday.  A couple strange things happened after my alerts were hit. Can someone tell me how to fix?  about an hours after the alert and the reverse were hit were hit I was able to get back to my screen and the chart was poltting as a flat line.  I clicked on the alert and the chart returned to normal but that apparently ended the alert. When I checked to see why I didn't get any alerts today, I found that no alerts were active even though I had set to expire in Jan 2019.
17:28 Vimes: yep, really other software would be better to backtest because it doesn't include dividends, i guess i could try to add a proxy for that
17:29 Vimes: another thing to consider is its considering prior data, so i don't think its factoring in the current volatility in this month
17:29 AlphaInvestor: Barry - if it is a MarketWatch Alert .. you need to set it up to do Reverse Crossovers
17:29 AlphaInvestor: Vimes - likely not.
17:30 AlphaInvestor: An adaptation could be to use a user selectible mix of historic and implied volatiltiy
17:30 Vimes: i've always picked stocks outside my 401k but am intriqued by some of these factor models lately so just playing with them
17:32 Vimes: not sure links will stick:
https://logical-invest.com/universal-investment-strategy/
17:32 AlphaInvestor: AQR has a great paper on factor investing
Liquid Alt Ragnarok?
17:33 Vimes: yes i've started listening to some of their podcasts
17:33 Vimes: there is a good book for a novice like me :) by Berkin and Swedroe, called "Your complete guid to factor-based investing..."
17:34 Vimes: it is a very plain and simple summary of alot of the prior research
17:35 AlphaInvestor: Cliff Asness at AQR does a lot of that sumarizing too, but it can get kinda deep
17:35 Vimes: i worry alot on stat research though, because likely there is so much maniuplation of the data and screeneing etc. that you really don't know how they actually implement it in practice.  It seems these things never really play out in reall measured returns versus the backtest
17:36 AlphaInvestor: Vimes - a couple of my standard fundie screens are now Factor based, with custom Factor Tilts. Been using them for about a year and a half.
17:40 Vimes: do you use a service for that?
17:41 Nube: It isn't the fudging of the data that concerns me so much as something that worked well the last 20 years would be expected to not work well over the next 20
17:42 Vimes: that too, i'm not saying grad students are dishonest but at some point when you are trying to get published and get your phd you can talk yourself into throwing out all sorts of outliiers to make your model work
17:42 Nube: Sound, foundational factors probably not as bug of a concern, but a lot of the newer ones would concern me
17:43 Vimes: well the factors in the book i mentioned all pass the logic test for a solid investing plan so i believe the results, but as i've gotten older i'm more about not losing my money so don't want to experiment too much
17:45 AlphaInvestor: Vimes - I experiment with phantom portolios - my longest running is over 10 years old, I transfer what works to real $$
17:46 Vimes: i started investing with ibd and the fool nearly two decades ago, and both had a tilt to combination of technical and fundamental factors
17:46 Vimes: maybe more so ibd on the technical side
17:46 AlphaInvestor: example, everyone was big on Piotroski a while back. I implemented a phantom portolio that selected all the 8 and 9 rated stocks using Piotroski ... a big loser
17:47 Vimes: yes i've played with that as well using guru focus
17:47 AlphaInvestor: ran that succa for almost 5 years before giving it up because it Never outperformed
17:49 AlphaInvestor: Later Scripters
17:49 Vimes: later ai
17:50 JohnnyQuotron: later Alpha
17:50 MTS1: Not familiar or researched the P3 Squeeze Frank; so don't know what it is based on.
17:51 Vimes: i was curioius and looked it up on the tube, not sure its worth diverting a lot of time too unless someone is need of a direction
17:52 Vimes: looked to usee PPO and ADx, if not mistaken to time long entries when they pinch together
17:53 MTS1: Nube; what I've seen when DK executes it (in-out) he advocates taking profit at certain %, sooner (lower %) if it gets there quicker than expected. As I recall that was also what Mobius suggested the other day when he advocated for the strat.
17:54 Vimes: you would place the PPO chart above the ADX chart in the lower stack
17:54 MTS1: Letting it run to expiration applies to the Risk sidel if it does not go your way right away don't close it out.
17:57 Nube: I should have specified I was thinking specifically that ronco strat. I only ever said 1 to 1 which is not the same thing
17:59 Vimes: are they tracking the trades they have made - i always am a little skeptical on short dated options, i guess if there is a clear long trigger the premium should be really small so you aren't risking much
17:59 MTS1: I thought ronco was in-out; but I could have misundersood; was the first time I heard of it this week;)
18:00 JohnnyQuotron: Nube,, regarding DKs In and Out.  out at 50-55% profit assuming it is going your way.   never buy an in out before earnings that expires in the week or two after earnings.  more if you want it
18:01 Nube: I think it is an in and out, but I thought the purpose of it was to not manage it. You have ot have a heckuva win percentage to make a 1 to 1 work if you're punching out half the way done
18:01 MTS1: Not sure imes; I trust Mobius and DK, but don't have proof;)  DK might provide records when you're on his service, but I know he's a stats quant and has a reputation to uphold. 
18:02 MTS1: Nube; Mobius mentioned 80% as I recall; have to look back in teh archives for his rules.
18:02 JohnnyQuotron: the in out is a quant strategy.   
18:02 JohnnyQuotron: take the 55% and run.  
18:03 Nube: I think that was the ronco he was talking about. All 1 to 1's I dunno
18:03 JohnnyQuotron: in at no more than 1.03% of the spread between the long and short strikes
18:03 JohnnyQuotron: pleasedefine 1 to 1
18:05 JohnnyQuotron: 1 long call 1 short call on the bull side
18:05 JohnnyQuotron: 1 long put 1 short put on the bear side
18:05 JohnnyQuotron: prefers debit to credit spreads for in out
18:05 Nube: At 1 to 1 you would need mid 50s percent win just to break even. I can't imagine talking off a 1 to 1 at 50  based strictly on strike selection and not some other statistic.
18:07 Nube: 1 to 1 is risk : reward. Yes, an in out spread, most commonly 2 dollars wide at a cost of a buck
18:07 JohnnyQuotron: the theory is that with tight strikes and decent volatility and a 55% profit target the target will get hit alot.  (alot being a highly educated math term)
18:08 Nube: But 5 wide at 2.50 is where it will need to be on most stocks with a 3 digit handle
18:08 JohnnyQuotron: no hard stops EVER
18:09 Nube: Well, whether ronco only or all 1 to 1's I'm sure they have their numbers chosen for a reason
18:09 JohnnyQuotron: 10 with google... painful
18:11 Nube: Yea, but it would be a darned good hedge for a long tech position
18:12 MTS1: when you lose 50% before expiry you still have chance it goes to BE or profit. when u gain more than 50% and don't take it you have chance to lose it still. I'm not a Quant geak but that's how I understand it may work;) Especially if put on@extremes, reversion to mean trades
18:32 Nube: Sounds pretty quanty to me
19:04 MTS1: a good quant could explain it better if that is part of the edge; that's just how I wrap my simple brain around it in plain English. . Another side comment I heard DK make is that you won't usually get 100% profit unless both are ITM and you let them get assigned.
19:23 Nube: Make sure you're seating before you read the following. I'm serious. Sit. Down. Ready? the most stable currency in the world right now is Bitcoin
19:28 amalia: Boom!Haters
19:29 UpTheCreek: ummm is that before orafter the 10% it lost yesterday?
19:33 EvanBStock: DK does say if prob of touch on the long option falls below 45% to exit right then and yes take 55-65% target. Speaking of, if Dons In/Out Strat is 80% and thats assuming 50/50 odds (up or down) if I throw in a backtested strategy (based on TA) thats correct for any given time frame roughly 75%(+-5%) How would that change the probabilities or would it just make you profitable faster? Any ideas?
19:46 admin_tculs: thinkScript Lounge chatroom will be closing soon  Please finish all conversaions by 8pm ct   Have a nice evening
19:47 Paris: MTS - noticed some commentary on Ronco, you might like to check your chat log of 10.1.2018 where Mobius discussed that, where he also included some tos.mx links.
19:54 Nube: Good point, UTC. Yesterday was not smooth but in recent months it's been about as stable as most G7 currency pairs

06:46 harndog: Good morning
06:47 Vimes: gm
06:48 stevie_s: .
06:56 Nube: Morning all!
07:00 ZupDog: gm everyone.   have been trying to create a TTM Squeeze Label that will tell me when the squeeze is long, short, or in the squeeze.   The label script I came up should be showing RED now for the 30 min /ZN chart.  But instead is showing green.  Any help here would be appreciated.      http://tos.mx/JhHrlw#
07:03 Vimes: try this from the source:
# Squeeze watchlist column - Eric Purdy 2017
# http://tos.mx/Ruon09#
def sqz = !TTM_Squeeze().SqueezeAlert;
def direction = TTM_Squeeze()>TTM_Squeeze()[1];
def count = if sqz and !sqz[1] then 1 else count[1]+1;
def fired = if !sqz and sqz[1] then 1 else 0;
def firedCount = if fired then 1 else firedCount[1]+1;
def firedDirection = if fired then direction else firedDirection[1];
addLabel(yes, if sqz then "Squeeze:" + count else if sum(fired,5) then "Fired:" + firedCOunt + if firedDirection then " Long" else " Short" else "-", if sqz then color.red else if sum(fired,5) and firedDirection then color.green else color.orange);
07:04 ZupDog: Thanks Vimes.  Will give it a try.
07:16 Paris: upDog - replace the following snippet in your study
AddLabel( yes, if Hist > Hist[1] then "SqzHist Up "  else "SqzHist Down" ,
    if Hist > Hist[1] then Color.GREEN
    else if Hist < Hist[1] then Color.RED
    else Color.GRAY);
07:20 ZupDog: Thanks Paris.  Will do.
07:21 Paris: If that doesn't do it, I'm sure I have another study in my archives that does the label correctly.
07:26 Vimes: The one i posted seems to show the squeeze on /zn for 6 bars: so could be modiifed to your liking
 
07:26 Paris: ZupDog I have a version that counts the number of bars in consequtice squeezes as well. I've seen many squeeze studies being posted here in the last few years. Many ways to do this.
07:27 Paris: BBL, heading out for a late dinner
07:28 ZupDog: Vimes,  the one you provided works for displaying the squeeze, but does not show if the histogram has fired long or short.   I can still use this study though. Thanks for sharing it.
07:30 ZupDog: Looks like I may have to use two separate  label scripts. One for a long / short squeeze histogram and the one that Vimes provided. 
07:31 Vimes: once fired the label will be colored based on the direction
07:31 Vimes: green long orange short
07:34 ZupDog: Gottch.  Did not read the script close enough to pick up on that.  So the label you provided is just what I was looking for.  Thanks again.  Now let's see if I can modify that script to give a count for how many bars long /short.
07:35 ZupDog: Paris, thanks for your help also.
07:37 Vimes: for me the signal is more accurate on larger time frames, shorter time frames i think its pretty poor indicator
07:55 Mobius: The histogram in that study (TTM Squeeze) is a momentum indicator. The "Squeeze" signal is generated from Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channel. Ther's absolutly no statistacal evidence to show which direction a squeeze will ressolve, whether up or down in a near term. For the longer term the direction is slightly more likey to be a continuation of it's longer term trend.
07:56 Mobius: This study and the TTM Squeeze are identical

07:57 Mobius: And Purdy is not the originator of that study.
07:59 Vimes: ok - he generated the label
07:59 Vimes: didn't say the underlying study
07:59 Mobius: Labels for that study have been around at least 10 years I know of
08:00 Vimes: he's afilliated with that group of guys is all, just trying to attribute to the source
08:00 Mobius: John Bollinger is the source not the other guys either
08:01 ZupDog: Thanks Mobius.    Glad to see you made it thru the storm okay and are doing well.
08:02 Mobius: yw.. Not much of a storm here. But it sure wacked Panama City and Mexico Beach. I have family there and they're not even able to get back in yet
08:02 Vimes: Mobius, so you wouldn't attribute the use of keltner channels and bollinger bands to JC? it was in his book where i originaly saw it
08:03 Mobius: Vimes no!  There's a lot of books in trading where a lot of writers claim a lot of stuff the just isn't true. 
08:05 Vimes: "isn't true" meaning sobeody else proposed this as a measure, or "isn't true" meaning it just is rubbish and doesn't work?
08:05 Mobius: Neither Standared Deviation nor an Average Range nor the combination of the two was new in this or the last century.
08:06 Vimes: gotcha
08:06 ZupDog: We ate at Toucans in Mexico Beach years ago. Very nice place right on the water.  At least The Gibson Inn is still standing in Appalatchacola. Sorry to hear about your family's loss though.
08:07 woodie: junk is more like it
08:07 Vimes: lol
08:07 Mobius: lol  woodie
08:07 woodie: gm mobius
08:07 Mobius: gm.. glad to see your still kickin
08:08 woodie: thanks, glad your ok from storm too
08:08 Vimes: i'm not trying to defend it but seems like there are dozens of indicators that are all trying to measure consolidation as a heads up for the next potentail larger move (up or down)
08:08 Mobius: yeah  Still haven't tested my concrete bunker. But I'm happy to wait to do so  :)
08:09 woodie: great
08:10 woodie: if you want to see consolidation better..put heiken asli bars on chart look for group of small body candles..
08:11 Vimes: thx woodie, will take a look
08:11 Mobius: Vimes... In mathematics that the measure of linearity. There's already many algorithms that do that quite well. And, that's been an object for those that specialize in higher geometry for centuries. How to measure a series with as little data as possible to predict a future line.
08:12 Vimes: so if you would what would be the best leading indicator to measure, such a period, and trade its breakout on either side
08:12 woodie: cci
08:13 Mobius: You just stated the problem. The "breakout". There's nothing that proves a breakout will go any one direction. Reason - Market movement is random and any smaller aggregation.
08:14 woodie: mobius has some great stuff on his MYTRADE page
08:14 Vimes: no i get that, and that' sthe risk i'm comforatble taking in trading, i guess i'm just asking if you had to choose an indiator suite for such a thing what it woudl be
08:16 Mobius: I use a log price distribution drawn as a range while price compresses and trade after the breakout and retest of the area. I use my typical approach of knowing what I'm willing to risk to test the trade and when I'll make it a risk free trade if it goes my way. And, that study is on MyTrade already
08:17 Vimes: thx
08:17 Mobius: yw
08:20 woodie: a real good one is mobius cci gauassian with linear regression
08:20 Mobius: FYI - Any price compression study, Bollinger Band Width, ADX, Squeeze, Fractal Energy or any other can be traded the exact same way
08:21 Vimes: yep, i use risk off quite a bit, i need to be more dynamic about it but i typically just have a standard risk off target and then move to break even
08:22 AJayKC: #this label will show Earnings in days

08:23 AJayKC: hi quick question. this code is not properly working. it shows everything in Earnings in 1 days.
08:23 AJayKC: anything that needed to be adjusted with the code or i'm doing something wrong? help please.
08:24 Mobius:  Typical Squeeze. Drawn as a range on the price chart rather than just points. You can see the initial breakout was lower. That didn't hold and the channel was retested then there's a breakout up which is now failing. That is typical. Making the Squeeze just another area of Balance.
08:24 AJayKC: for example MSFT it says today is earnings. HEAR's earnings is november 1st but it says in 1 day.
08:25 MTS1: AJ; What aggregation are you running it at and how big is your expansion area?
08:25 AJayKC: i am using on daily chart max.
08:25 Vimes: thanks for the illustration mobius, very helpful, will try and find the study and look into it
08:25 UpTheCreek: ya gotta have enough exp area to actually see the earnings date
08:25 MTS1: No; there is no try. . . ;)
08:26 AJayKC: creek how i make sure of that?
08:26 Vimes: :) well there are lot of studies on his mytrade, if that was to me:) so have to find the matching one
08:26 UpTheCreek: ^^^ lol
08:26 Mobius: Vimes - That particular study is Squeeze Pivots
08:27 Vimes: cool, thanks, good discussion
08:27 mthfr_vaxxed: you can view earnings on the calendar. easier than seeing it on chart if its far out
08:27 UpTheCreek: chart settings, expansion area = whatever your criteria in the future is
08:27 AJayKC: ok thank you creek. i changed that and it seemed to work. i appreciate your help.
08:27 mthfr_vaxxed: marketwatch > calendar
08:28 AJayKC: also thank you MTS1.
08:28 UpTheCreek: yw
08:30 Mobius: And we're off
08:31 Nube: Where did the volume go the last couple of hours? it seemed fine all night and then it's like people just stopped trsding
08:31 Vimes: wow lag
08:32 chief: charts doa again
08:34 Wally: lag again like yesterday at open
08:42 mthfr_vaxxed: you make support ticket? sometimes devs dont know there is problem until its reported
08:45 chief: Yes.. Too many trsders doing too much trsding
08:49 tajtx: Mobius.   On one of your studies there is a notification of "Target Breached".   What does that mean?
08:50 JohnnyQuotron: Good Morning thinkScript Lounge...
08:52 MTS1: Taj; seems self explanatory?
08:52 MTS1: If you don't understand the target; find it in the script to understand.
08:53 tajtx: Could mean target to buy or target to sell?    I respect Mobius and want to make sure I understand the notification.    
08:54 JohnnyQuotron: Just to clarify, regarding the tos VWAP, when chat aggregation is set to 10 min and VWAP is set to daily, does the vwap calculation begin when the chart begins ?  Or does it begin at midnight?  Or does it begin at some other time?
08:54 JohnnyQuotron: chat = chart sorry
08:58 MTS1: Taj; yes. Don't think he knows either what indicator you're refering to; but typically I've seen them in a color indicating target buy / sell, and again if you read the code there may be further clues.
08:59 tajtx: I'll try and understand the code.    Thanks for the feedback.
08:59 MTS1: JQ; don't you see the median/sd lines re-set on the chart?
09:03 MTS1: On mine they restart when globex overnight starts at 6PM ET on futs
09:21 Paris: MTS - Just wanted to make sure you received that eml response, I had to send a couple of times due to formatting issues on my end
09:22 Paris: Signing out for the night, anything else you know where to ping me. Later MTS
09:52 JohnnyQuotron: I need some help with the addchartbubbles on this script  http://tos.mx/CeMzoE#
yes this is embarrassing.  i would really like the cyan bubble to paint on the first lower cyan dot and the orange bubble first lower orange dot
but i can't get the logic correct for the x-axis location  ...  if anyone can find the time later I would really appreciate the assistance
09:52 JohnnyQuotron: nite Paris
09:55 JohnnyQuotron: Mts.. looks like the openning of electronic trading at about 5:00 eastern? for \ES
09:55 RayK: Hi. My buffer is missing from room open to 7:47 EDT. Can someone please PB it to me? Thanks in  advance.
09:55 AlphaInvestor: The most important part of a bubbleMover script is the      showBubbles = NO input
09:56 JohnnyQuotron: ray the onenote is current
09:57 cajun: Ray, there was just a gm
09:58 JohnnyQuotron: alpha...i am not using that imput for the FE bubbles at the moment.  look down to around line 250.  sorry
09:59 JohnnyQuotron: mobius .. would you say your balance area held?
10:02 anees: hello everyone, can someone tell me where i can find the ATR filter in the scanner please
10:02 beta888: Hi, is there anyway to draw a line across the chart  that will follow current price of a stock?
10:03 Mobius: Johnny - here's the method to add those bubbles
addChartBubble(FE crosses below valueFElinear, -.1, "Linear", color.cyan, yes);
10:04 AlphaInvestor: Here is the way I did it:
addChartBubble( if pointslinear and isnan(pointslinear[1]) then 1 else 0 , -0.05, "Trend Exhaustion", pointslinear.takevaluecolor());
10:04 DMonkey: beta....
plot Data = highestall(if isnan(close[-1]) then close else double.nan);
10:05 Mobius: anees - Did you try under ATR?
10:07 Mobius: johnny - It's held so far. The day is young.
10:08 beta888: Thanks, i will try that
10:09 anees: hey Mobius, i dont find it, either im blind or im blind, does it even exist?
10:11 Mobius: Typical Bull Market Ends when there are New Lower Lows and Lower Highs first at the intraday levels then on the higher aggregations. So first indication of this Bull ending would be a price extension to within about 1% of the high and a failure to a new pivot low on the daily aggregation. We just had that. Now we look for another drive toward the high and a failure below the last attempt. Then another new low.
10:13 JohnnyQuotron: mobius.. regarding the bubbles.  I only want one of the first orange and cyan dot.  not on each cross.  thank you though.  I should have been more clear
10:13 Mobius: anees.  
Average(TrueRange(high, close, low), 10)
10:14 Mobius: First dot for the day, first dot for the chart?
10:14 JohnnyQuotron: first orange dot on the chart and first cyan dot on the chart
10:15 Mobius: the do a recursive count and take only the first in the count.
10:15 JohnnyQuotron: i dont know how to do that yet
10:16 AlphaInvestor: JQ - the code I posted plots at the first cyan dot of any new set of cyan dots
10:17 Mobius: def count = if FE crosses below valueFElinear
                     then count[1] + 1
                    else count[1];
addChartBubble(count == 1, ..........................)
10:18 JohnnyQuotron: mobius thank you.  Alpha sorry i didnt see the second post.  my apologies
10:24 ramesh2599: Mobis: could you pl post that code- Thanks----- Mobius: Vimes - That particular study is Squeeze Pivots
10:26 UpTheCreek: Ramesh, where does Mobius generally post his codes?
10:27 ramesh2599: I could not locate it:(
10:29 anees: thanks mobius, what im basically trying to do is find or make a filter that finds stocks that overextended 5-6 times their usual Range, can you advise please? thanks
10:30 mthfr_vaxxed: Johnny: you check the automated logs? now you dont have to worry about missing something! ....hopefully
10:31 Mobius: Johnny - before you drive yourself crazy - I should have indexed that count. Use this as your template
def count1 = if barNumber() > 1 and FE < valueFElinear
             then compoundValue(1, count1[1] + 1, 1)
             else count1[1];
addChartBubble(count1 == 1, 0, "Linear", color.cyan, yes);
10:31 NUG: Hey Mobius, do yo know if TOS is going to restore the drawings for continuous futures contracts any time soon (or at all)?
10:33 Mobius: anees - simple logic
TrueRange(high, close, low) > Average(TrueRange(high, close, low), 10) * 5
10:34 JohnnyQuotron: Mobius... thank you... i was driving myself crazy  But I was too embarassed to admit it.
10:35 Mobius: NUG - I'm not privy to any other information than what you or anyone else gets
10:36 ramesh2599: Mobi- I found it, Thanks
10:37 Mobius: sorry Johnny - One of the problems with codeing in the chat window.
10:37 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current.  BBL thank you all for the assistance !
10:37 Mobius: <<< To lazy to open the editor
10:39 JohnnyQuotron: Mobius.. thank you for setting me on the right path.  You as well alpha.  Maybe my next Padawan's guide should be recursive counting?   Oh my!
10:42 NUG: Mobius, thanks
10:43 anees: thank you so much Mobius
10:44 JohnnyQuotron: Oops.. someone forget to screw in their drain plug before thay put their 25-30 foot center console fishing boat in the water this morning.  Here comes the Coast Guard....
10:46 AlphaInvestor: JQkpa - I forgot to put mine in once on my 20 foot Yamaha - it has 5 plugs, I missed one. Go back to the boat launch, but not without considerable bailing and panic.
10:50 Nube: That's why I don't boat.
10:50 Nube: I'm not a details person
10:52 Vimes: its' good to have friends with boats
10:52 Nube: Also, we might be shaping up for interesting Sunday night. We aren't far from the 720 Mobius was watching.
10:58 MTS1: JQ; thought you were refering to the markets at first when you posted about someone forgetting the drain plug. .
10:59 MTS1: MTH; prefer logs with pictures; but nice to have an automated backup so that's appreciated!
11:11 JohnnyQuotron: mth... update me on the automated log thingy again please..
11:14 UpTheCreek: in his mytrade
11:17 mthfr_vaxxed: yup. got a script running that sends logs out to github. updates logs locally every 10 min. sends to github every 2 hours during weekdays
11:18 mthfr_vaxxed: but yea....no pictures... yet
11:24 JohnnyQuotron: mth... excellent work  how does your app send to github?  can the app email?
11:27 JohnnyQuotron: Oops the crane barge is going to be too late... the Center Console is beneath the waves
11:28 JohnnyQuotron: and the SPY is not looking much better
11:28 Nube: Analogy for Europe's markets today.
11:29 AlphaInvestor: hopefully not your center console JQkpa
11:31 mthfr_vaxxed: just python script. does a `git add && git push` bash command.
11:31 mthfr_vaxxed: and you could script up email .... but then your working backwords. revision control is where the cool kids hang out
11:33 MTS1: JQ in Linux is what MTH is saying also, if you're familiar with that.
11:33 mthfr_vaxxed: yeah. microsoft just got a bash prompt last year i think so you can be cool too
11:34 mthfr_vaxxed: and linux got powershell i think? that one confuses me.
11:35 UpTheCreek: lol
12:00 JohnnyQuotron: Alpha... no, not my boat.  Divers just arrived and attached bouyancy bags to the stern and gassed the ow to bring her up.  photos aftert the close
12:01 JohnnyQuotron: mthr.. so can your python script email the logs?  sorry dont know python at all
12:03 mthfr_vaxxed: that would be a diff script. but yeah.
12:06 and76: Hi All,How can I make  plot the line on the right extension on this    ########       def avg = Average(close(period = AggPeriod), length);
def SD = StDev(close(period = AggPeriod), length);
plot Mean = highestAll(if isNaN(close[-1]) 
                               then avg
                               else Double.NaN);
Mean.SetDefaultColor(Color.white);
addChartBubble(isNaN(close[3]) and !isNaN(close[4]), 
               Mean, 
             " Mean " +
               AsDollars(Mean), 
               color.white, yes);                              this belongs to a sd lines by Mobius script and lines are plot on the chart,thanks
12:06 JohnnyQuotron: if python could email me the logs after theroom loses each day that would provide an excellent backup data source if we humans fail.
12:07 mthfr_vaxxed: git > email
12:07 UpTheCreek: JQ, the logs are in git
12:07 mthfr_vaxxed: also mirrored on gitlab in case microsoft screws up github :)
12:07 UpTheCreek: +1
12:08 JohnnyQuotron: ust a thought to make it easier for me to fill gaps from my email rather than git. Im lazy i guess.
12:09 mthfr_vaxxed: me too :) thats why i built this thing
12:09 UpTheCreek: probly the same # of mouse clicks once bookmarked, but whatever :)
12:09 mthfr_vaxxed: but still havent coded my stupid portfolio yet.
12:10 JohnnyQuotron: up ou are likely correct
12:10 AlphaInvestor: JQ - RayK keeps a copy, you keep a kopy, now MTH keeps a copy. dats enough backups
12:11 mthfr_vaxxed: lol
12:11 JohnnyQuotron: you are correct
12:11 Vimes: but the onenote has some nice organization
12:12 mthfr_vaxxed: i loved the organization. i hated the slowness of clicking between tabs
12:12 JohnnyQuotron: MACD question?  is the sell triggered when the leader or lagggard crosses below the zero line.  I dont use the indicator.  just curious.
12:12 Vimes: so whatever helps JQ maintain that is really great
12:12 mthfr_vaxxed: and couldn't mass download everything
12:13 AlphaInvestor: JQkpa - neither, it is when the Histogram crosses zero
12:14 JohnnyQuotron: mthr... iswitching tabs is much faster using the desktop version of OneNote.  Which I think is free now. but dont hold me to that.
12:14 AlphaInvestor: seriously laggy tho! When I uused MACD, I used 3 bars in the same direction, trade on the 4th bar. Ignored zero crosses. Now I no longer even show it on my charts
12:15 JohnnyQuotron: thanks alpha.  I thought Bierman preached that the macd was still bullish until one or the other of the lines crossed below.  Ill check his archive this weekend.
12:16 AlphaInvestor: well, uncle Jeffy would know
12:18 JohnnyQuotron: I will say this.. if I had ligthened up when the daily Self Adjusting RSI Laguerre turned down on 9/24+- I would have saved myselff a great deal if pain.  Pain is the best memory tool i know though.
12:20 Vimes: almost a perfect gap fill, lets see if we can go back and get the other side of the range, optimistically
12:22 John1a: Does this need a study to plot? When I enter $ADSPD/$TVOLSP it says it cannot find the symbol. Does anyone have a study that can plot this? Thank you.
12:23 MTS1: yes john; the ticker entry does not allow divide operator
12:23 MTS1: just put that in a plot and you can plot a line
12:23 Biometrizilla: Does anyone have the code behind the InertiaAll function? I am doing some analysis using linear regression trendlines and need to customize the function. Code for Inertia is on the Website, but not InertiaAll. Inertia plots the endpoint of the linear regression (LinearRegressionCurve) - I want to plot the full trendline across the period.
12:28 Nube: Bio, InertiaAll() allows you to select y and n values, check the manual for deets. Do you need more than that?
12:35 MTS1: And this is what I found by the famous notsoNube; still going over my head but may help:
# Nube: In case anyone else would like to do a similar project
#
# Reproduction of ToS InertiaAll()
# Nube
# v0.01 8.26.18
# Step 1 toward attempting to make variable length regression slope
input TosInertia = no;
input y = close;
input n = 40;
def na = Double.NaN;
def bn = BarNumber();
# start and end bars
def developingBar = if !IsNaN(y) and IsNaN(y[-1])
then bn
else developingBar[1];
def currentBar = HighestAll(developingBar);
def trailingBar = if GetValue(bn, -n) == currentBar
then bn else trailingBar[1];
def startingBar = HighestAll(trailingBar);
def x = if GetValue(bn, -n) = currentBar
then bn - startingBar else x[1];
# arithmetic
def Ex = Sum(x,n);
def Ey = Sum(y,n);
def Exy = Sum(x*y,n);
def Ex2 = Sum(x*x,n);
# math
def b = (n * Exy - (Ex * Ey))/
(n * Ex2 - (Ex * Ex));
def getB = if bn startingBar # --- brings most recent b value to previous bars
then GetValue(b, bn - currentBar)
else na;
def a = (GetValue(Ey, bn - currentBar) - getB *
GetValue(Ex, bn - currentBar))/n;
plot line = if !IsNaN(getB) !IsNaN(y)
then a + (getB * x)
line.SetDefaultColor(Color.Yellow);
line.SetStyle(Curve.Points);
plot Slope = if TosInertia then InertiaAll(y,n) else na;
Slope.SetDefaultColor(Color.Cyan);
12:38 Biometrizilla: Nube, not sure if that's enough or not, but you may have given me an idea. I presume I can make y be anything I want, not just open/close/etc. That may solve my problem.
12:39 Biometrizilla: MTS1 - Thanks much. I'll take a look.
12:51 angeltd: anyone knows how to configured a houly simple move average crossover graph for three data points (13,30,200) hour?
12:51 angeltd: in thinkorswim please
12:57 MTS1: Just plot the SMA's? Guess I'm missing something...
12:59 UpTheCreek: there's a MovingAvgCrossover study built in, you can program the variables that you want to use
13:00 PBJ: I wonder if someone can assist me? I've been searching online, and can't seem to find/modify something that will fit my request.
I'd like to create a label that will show after the first 5 minute candle has completed. As the second candle is forming, it will show the percentage increase and/or decrease based on the first candles range. After the second candle has completed, it will stop, with no further calculations.
Thank you.
13:03 Nube: Bio, exactly. Doesn't have to be close, can be whatever variable you out I. there.
13:08 UpTheCreek: pbj, assuming you are on a 5m chart, just capture the open and close of whatever bar you care about using GetTime() as the trigger and shove the resulting math into Addlabel()
13:10 and76: Hi All,How can I make  plot the line on the right extension on this    ########       def avg = Average(close(period = AggPeriod), length);
               color.white, yes);                              this belongs to a sd lines by Mobius script and lines are plot on the chart,thanks Again
13:11 PBJ: UTC thanks, I've been trying all morning, and no closer unfortunately...
13:12 UpTheCreek: what part doesn't work?
13:12 naservos: Sorry, new to the forum...I have a strategy (kinda) that I'd like to turn into a scan...but I have zero coding skills....anyone recommend help??
13:16 mthfr_vaxxed: explain it as clearly as possible and if its interesting someone will code it. if its not....they will probably tell you why
13:18 naservos: Fair enough...would like to scan for stocks with 5 consecutive daily closes at or above Bollinger Bands with a deviation of .382 instead of the usual 2
13:21 UpTheCreek: do you know how to code your  close above the funky BBand?
13:22 mthfr_vaxxed: lol...why funky? which band do you like UTC?
13:22 UpTheCreek: .382 is funky
13:22 mthfr_vaxxed: and .3 deviation? not percent? why that number
13:22 Vimes: you are going to get alot of hits: check if this works:
def uBB = BollingerBands("num dev up" = 0.382).UpperBand;
def ridn382 = close>=uBB;
plot scan = sum(ridn382,5)==5;
13:23 UpTheCreek: it's a fib of course
13:23 mthfr_vaxxed: ah ok. that guy again (mandlebrot)
13:23 UpTheCreek: ya
13:23 LongShort: darn, Vimes beat me to it
13:23 mthfr_vaxxed: yeah....so too many hits naservos...what other criteria ya got
13:24 naservos: Thank you...will try it...
13:24 UpTheCreek: vendors
13:24 Vimes: it also could be wrong - i didn't check it
13:24 LongShort: twasn't mandelbrot, it was Fibbonacci
13:25 LongShort: Vimes took 2 more lines than I did tho:
plot above5 = sum(close > bollingerbands(close,0,20,-0.382,0.382,"SIMPLE").UpperBand,5) >= 5;
13:26 mthfr_vaxxed: fibbonacci found it nature. mandlebrot made it popular in the markets. (i think?)
13:27 Vimes: yep that looks right as well, just like to define things separately
13:27 mthfr_vaxxed: physics of wall street was interesting read. no strategies. just history.
13:28 UpTheCreek: geek time
13:28 AlphaInvestor: who is this LongShort guy?
13:28 Vimes: lol, do ou have two accounts?
13:29 AlphaInvestor: 4 actually, but who's counting
13:29 Vimes: hmm all mine are linked, but i guess now you can have arugments with yourself
13:31 Vimes: LongShort: that Alpha is the smartest guy in the room
13:33 AlphaInvestor: one of the top 89, fo shu
13:33 John1a: Any idea what creates a divergence like this? https://www.screencast.com/t/3cwZOEjirIdW
How can it sell off like this when it seems that there is a lot more buying volume than selling.
13:34 naservos: Thank you Vimes!!! When I add filters like Ask and Volume....results were reasonable...
13:34 angeltd: thank you
13:34 Vimes: np
13:48 bigworm: i see you typing mobius
13:48 bigworm: its what i live for
13:48 Vimes: lol, too funny
13:49 Mobius: john.. What divergence? One chart is up-dn volume and the other is AD line. They don't represent divergence
13:49 Mobius: big.. go do your homework  :)
13:49 amalia: haha
13:50 Vimes: we all like it when Mobius types something profound
13:50 bigworm: lol i am about to start
13:50 Mobius: geez   I'm just an old school teacher. 
13:51 bigworm: lol
13:51 John1a: Mobius: It seems to show that there is a lot more buying than selling on volume, yet the price goes in an opposite direction.
13:53 Vimes: well mobius we are all waiting for you to put on your trading school
13:54 PBJ: From my earlier post. In all honesty, I'm not good at coding, but would love some assistance. What I've tried is a hideous mess.
13:55 Vimes: PBJ, % change of the range?
13:56 Vimes: % is based on what?
13:56 amalia: Percentage difference I think
13:57 amalia: Percentage difference from the opening or the close of the previous 5m bar?
13:58 UpTheCreek: vimes, you're in the wrong color
13:58 PBJ: I'm typing
13:59 AlphaInvestor: I wish TOS went back to one background color
13:59 Vimes: utc, sorry bout that
14:01 Mobius: John - rethink what your looking at
14:03 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - that's what I thot, then had to take a second look
14:03 AlphaInvestor: that is not divergent
14:08 John1a: Mobius: What is it?
14:08 bigworm: were you ever very vague when you were instructing mobius? i see some usefullness in figuring things out for yourself but i ask myself why even show up to class if they dont cover the material well or at all and then assign hw or projects that have not been looked at.
14:09 Mobius: PBJ - 
# Percent Variance from opening candle to the second candle
# Chat Room Request 10.12.2018
def firstBar = if getTime() crosses above RegulartradingStart(getYYYYMMDD())
               then barNumber()
               else double.nan;
def firstClose = if barNumber() == highestAll(firstBar)
                 then close
                 else firstClose[1];
def secondClose = if barNumber() == highestAll(firstBar + 1)
                  then close
                  else secondClose[1];
def p = (secondClose - firstClose) / firstClose;
AddLabel(1, "Percent Variance = " + AsPercent(p), color.white);
14:10 Vimes: her's what i came up with likely wrong
def isfirstbar = gettime() crosses above regularTradingStart(getyYYYMMDD());
def firstbar_range = if isfirstbar then high-low else if isfirstbar[1] then firstbar_range[1] else 0;
def second_range_ = if isfirstbar[1] then (high-low)/firstbar_range else second_range_[1];
addlabel(yes,aspercent(second_range_));
14:10 PBJ: OMG, you created that faster than I could type up a more detailed description. YOU ARE AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank you!!!!!!
14:11 PBJ: Mobius and Vimes :)
14:11 Mobius: big... class is to teach you how to think for yourself and show you where to find others current thinking.
14:11 AlphaInvestor: Here's what I came up with:
How da heck am I gunna make  money wit dat?   Don't know, so no workie
14:12 Vimes: if the second range is close to a fib number by on the next candle
14:12 AlphaInvestor: Mobius +1
14:13 AlphaInvestor: Mobius / Bigworm - I realized early on ... University is to        Learn How To Learn
14:13 Vimes: PBJ, it would actually be interesting to know what you are doing what that number?
14:13 Mobius: Mine is not to wonder why - mine is to code or die.. If I only coded what I knew worked I'd have stopped coding years ago.. :)
14:14 Vimes: well you are very good at it- its good to do what you are good at ;)
14:14 Mobius: internet and power keep going off here. Generator transfer is switching on and off. Wonder if that's as bad as it seems it is
14:14 Nube: Same here, Alpha. Post grade school is when I learned that using a textbook properly is a skill that has to be learned
14:15 Nube: Gather all the whiskey quick before the lights go out for hood.
14:15 Mobius: ha
14:16 Mobius: That is never too far from my reach  :)
14:17 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - I ahave a SOLA Transformer at home to send sine wave power to my computer
14:17 Nube: On a more serious note, are we shaping up for 50 plus point night Sunday or am I too excitable?
14:19 Mobius: Nube we're trading an inside day. That's market neutral to me.
14:21 Vimes: i got a dal ronco long alert
14:29 Mobius: Fractal charts don't indicate DAL as a trade that I'd take right now. Although daily signal may be ok weekly is just starting in a downward move and monthly is already at the high with energy.  Too conflicting for me
14:36 Vimes: i see that, thanks
14:36 AlphaInvestor: I was surprised by DAL's strength yesterday
14:37 Vimes: yeah, i wasn't aggressive enough yesterday, but me thinkgs we will get another pullback next week
14:38 Vimes: they had earnings today, and some theories that airlines will show strength into the eoy
14:41 AlphaInvestor: not if Iran isn't selling oil
14:44 Nube: TLRYs strength has surprised me also.
14:45 Nube: Going to be bummed if we got within half a percent of my limit order for VT. I might never be able to retire now.
14:50 Mobius: Dad used to say "Never trade wives or airlines. You eventually crash and burn with one and go broke doing the other." He'd never explain which was which though.
14:50 Vimes: lol
14:53 AlphaInvestor: ha
14:55 Vimes: nq took a round trip today and looks like we might close hod
15:02 Mobius: ORB predicted a close below 2772.75 on /ES. It was a squeeker but it made it below that
15:04 Mobius: Time to go for a walk. It's at least 40ft to the bar. Later folks.
15:09 Vimes: Learned something recently that i thought was neat, if you form a quote of up to 8 symbols that represent a basket of stocks you want to trade, you can route that trade all at once.  The percentage needs to work out to 100% so there aren't any fractional shares, so for example:  AAPL*.18+GOOGL*.17+MSFT*.15+AMZN*.15+FB*.12+BRK/B*.11+JNJ*.08+V*.06
15:14 amalia: I know there’s DÍA/DJI/etc but mobile won’t accept all 30 DOW tickers/30
15:16 Davtrader001: Hey Guys. I could use some help, please.  
I'm having a problem with this TOS RTD to Excel formula.  
=RTD("tos.rtd","tos.rtd","P_L_DAY","SPX")   
I can get all of these to work (note the symbol):  
=RTD("tos.rtd","tos.rtd","P_L_YTD","SPX")
=RTD("tos.rtd","tos.rtd","P_L_YTD","SPY")
=RTD("tos.rtd","tos.rtd","P_L_OPEN","SPY")
=RTD("tos.rtd","tos.rtd","P_L_DAY","SPY")
For some reason I can't get the SPX "P_L_OPEN" or "P_L_DAY"
(they work with SPY, just not SPX)  Can anyone please help tell me what I'm doing wrong ?
15:16 UpTheCreek: yes, you are using the wrong font
15:19 AlphaInvestor: SPX doesn't trade ... so how could you have a P&L for it
15:19 Vimes: options
15:19 Vimes: ?
15:19 AlphaInvestor: Well, then he would have to put in the options .OPRA code in for the symbol
15:19 Vimes: bet that's it
15:19 Davtrader001: Yes, I'm sorry. SPX Options
15:21 Davtrader001: I can get SPX P_N_L_YTD to work... just not P_N_L_OPEN and P_N_L_Day
15:22 Davtrader001: It's weird it world work for one of them and not the other two.
15:23 AlphaInvestor: what value do you get for SPX P_N_L_YTD?
15:24 Davtrader001: I get the PnL for all my SPX trades for the YTD. The same total that shows up in the Account Statement Tab in TOS.
15:25 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current.
15:26 Vimes: I think alpha is suggesting for your open positions you need to build it differently so if you are short the 2715 try putting in .SPX181116P2715
15:28 AlphaInvestor: I have my Account Statement broken into Equities and Options ... Options p&l and Equity p&l  don't mix on my sheets
15:29 Davtrader001: Yes, I understand what he's saying. Thanks.
I know how to get an indivdual quote like you are saying but I was hoping there was a way to simply get the PnL Day just like I can get PnL YTD.
I have way too many postions to build it out the other way.
15:31 Vimes: not sure there is
15:31 Vimes: maybe call tda support
15:33 Davtrader001: OK. Thanks for the help. I wasn't sure if I was just doing something wrong that was stupid / simple.
I'll have to dig into it some more.
15:33 AlphaInvestor: I have no idea how you accomplish what you do. It doesn't work like that for me
15:35 Davtrader001: Are you able to get this to work ?
15:42 Vimes: they don't work for me for any open options positions, spy, or otherwise
15:45 Davtrader001: Wow... OK... I haven't ever had a problem with any of the other ones that I posted above... Just the SPX Open and Day... That's weird you're having problems.... The RTD can be kind of finicky at times.
15:45 Davtrader001: The other format that is used is like this. You may want to try that and see.
=RTD("tos.rtd","P_L_YTD","SPX")
15:47 Vimes: that doesn't work for me , i use something like this :
=RTD("tos.rtd",,"P_L_YTD",UPPER(AF9))
15:49 Davtrader001: I'm sorry, but what does the UPPER(AF9) refer to ?
Is that a cell on your spreadsheet ?
15:49 Vimes: yes
15:50 Vimes: so you don't have to edit a bunch of formulas
15:50 Davtrader001: Where is that cell pulling the YTD info from . Is it from TOS ?
15:51 Vimes: AF9 contains teh symbol, lets say MSFT, and wherever you put that formula lets say in AG9 it will return the pNL from tos, yes
15:51 Davtrader001: OK.. Let me give that a try.
15:55 Davtrader001: In your cell AF9, is the symbol in quotes or simply just the letters ?
15:56 Vimes: just letters
15:58 Davtrader001: OK.. I got that to work. for the SPX YTD, but dang, it still doesn't work for SPX PnL Day.... This is bizzare.
