14:14 AJayKC: does somebody have it made already or can bistow me some guidance please?
14:14 John1a: Frank: I use indicators but as tools. Like you would use a soap to wash your hands, but you know how to wash your hands, the soap is just a tool that makes it easier
14:15 AJayKC: any help is much appreciated.
14:15 amalia: Define "near"
14:16 AJayKC: movingavgcrossover ( "l1" = 1 , "l2" = 195 , "crossing type" = "below" ) is true.
14:16 John1a: Frank: If you want to learn from one of the best look up Verniman on Google
14:16 AJayKC: something like that amalia. i don't want it coming from below 200 sma.
14:17 AJayKC: i prefer which is about to touchl
14:18 MTS1: Ajay; that is crossing over; different than above / below.
14:19 MTS1: You can have 2 scan filters; one checking for one MA being above another, second for price being close to MA.
14:19 FrankB3:   John,,, I agree..  Once knew a trader who VWAP in weekly SPX credit spreads,,, before it became popular...  may still have his course on VHS tape... I think Shadow Trader talks about it alot ???
14:20 MTS1: The built-in moving average scan will cover the price part, the MA above another I believe is there also or can easilly be built in the builder.
14:20 FrankB3:   Thanks John
14:20 MTS1: if you want moving avg crossover that's biult in also; but unlikely to find price close to slow MA as fast one is crossing over.
14:22 John1a: Frank: Yw! There is no right or wrong way to trade, per se, but you have to have the right foundation and then you can develop your own style.
14:27 Shaun11: Can Some one suggest on where  to find a ThinkScript professionals to create custom script for me.
14:28 John1a: Frank: There is a reason why they're called Bids and Offers, Bid/Ask, the market is an auction, so you have to learn how an auction process works and why the price moves in a first place. Once you get that, the rest are just details.
14:29 MTS1: Shaun; the good ones are here; post your request and see what happens. Likely you'll be pointed at resources to help you learn so you can do this yourself.
14:30 Joebone87: hey guys.. am i just missing it or can i scan based on div yeild? i thought for sure that was a default scan?
14:31 Joebone87: whoops
14:31 Joebone87: found it
14:31 Joebone87: how did i miss that
14:33 AJayKC: movingavgcrossover ("l1" = 50, "l2" = 200) is true.
14:33 AJayKC: sorry i got disconnected
14:34 John1a: Frank: It is just like Ebay only here they sell  the price of some stock or futures. It really does not matter, used books or ES, the basics of an auction process are the same.
14:36 FrankB3:     thanks, John,  will follow up
14:36 Shaun11: Hello MTS1: here is what I'm looing for.                                                   I would like to create an alert  as soon as  the price is greater than Upper bowlinger band( length 9, exponential) on the current bar. This is for a FOREX pair (eg:EUR/USD) on 15 minute chart.

and second condition: the bar length(the difference of low and high) is greater than 10 pips.
14:36 MTS1: Ajay; did you see my responses above?
14:37 John1a: yw
14:37 MTS1: What type of alert Shaun; on a chart, or email / SMS (which would mean marketwatch alert).
14:38 mthfr_vaxxed: Ajay:
14:38 mthfr_vaxxed: 
input price = close;
input length1 = 50;
input length2 = 200;
input percent = 10;
input averageType1 = AverageType.Simple;
input averageType2 = AverageType.Simple;
input crossingType = {default above, below};
def avg1 = MovingAverage(averageType1, price, length1);
def avg2 = MovingAverage(averageType2, price, length2);
plot signal = crosses(avg1 * 1 + (percent/100), avg2, crossingType == CrossingType.above);
14:38 Shaun11: Alert I mean an alarm( sound wave)
14:38 mthfr_vaxxed: delete the useless inputs or fix the code
14:39 AJayKC: thanks mts1 sorry i was having connection issue. i had to close the chatroom and open again.
14:39 AJayKC: i'll try that.
14:40 AJayKC: also thank you mthfr for that code. i'll sure try that code also. i appreciate.
14:40 AJayKC: sorry if u felt like i just asked the question and dissapeared.
14:41 mthfr_vaxxed: i dont feel
14:41 mthfr_vaxxed: jk
14:44 amalia: We are Vulcans/Borg
14:46 MTS1: Shaun; the bollingerbandscrossover is a built-in study which you can use for either. The chart alert sounds are limited to some pre-defined dings. The MW sound alerts may be customizable IIRC. For MW alerts you can built one in the alert builder; go to Marketwatch - Alerts, put in your pair,  select 'Study Alert', and in the condition builder specify Price, Crosses, and select the BB study and set your criteria . For Chart Alerts you'll have to copy the built-in script, give it a name, and add a line like : Alert(signal, "Cross Abpve BB", BAR, Sound.Chimes);
14:48 MTS1: Sounds lik you may be new to the platform; I'd contact support and have them schedule a platform tour; have 10 questions / features ready that you want to know more about to ask them & guide the tour.
14:54 MTS1: PS; a MW alert will run in the background, even if you don't have chart open. The Chart Study can be added to your chart without alerts if you build in MW and it will plot arrows where alerts should have gone off.
15:00 Shaun11: MTS1. Thanks you. I have tried the Bowlingband Crossover on the study alert  . it is selecting the bars which are closed above/below BB. I'm looking to identify the bars that are just crossed/closed.      condition below.....                                                                                                                 BollingerBandsCrossover("length" = 9, "band" = "lower", "crossing type" = "below", "average type" = "EXPONENTIAL") is true
15:00 toad1144: Can someone help me with this script i am getting an error on the plot line and dont know why
15:01 toad1144: declare lower;
MoneyFlowmultiplier = (close - open) / (high - low);
MoneyFlowVolume = MoneyFlowMultiplier * volume;
plot moneyFlowVolume = (previous period moneyflowvolume + current moneyflowvolume;
moneyflowVolume.SetDefaultColor(GetColor(1));
15:05 toad1144: hello??
15:07 Farmin: you can't make up your own syntax
15:07 Farmin: have yu read the thinkScript tutorials?
15:07 toad1144: yes
15:08 Farmin: then what illegal syntax do you have in the code above?
15:09 toad1144: its the previous period and current period but i cant find the correct syntax for those two
15:10 Farmin: read up on referencing historical data
15:10 toad1144: k thanks
15:19 MTS1: Shaun; not clear on what it is your're looking for that you're not getting from the indicator. Are you saying you want prior bar to have closed above? Thought you were saying current bar crossing above.
15:20 MTS1: Toad; it's chapter 10 of the TS tutorials iirc.
15:21 Joebone87: toad..  gotta read the tutorial.. but something to think about is that everything in TOS has to have a object name associated with it
15:21 Shaun11: Current bar which crossed the BB
15:21 Joebone87: so you plot moneyflow
15:22 Joebone87: to plot something name it first then give it a value
plot NAME_OF_IT = whatever your ploting
15:23 Shaun11: Bowlingband Crossover study results only the the bars that are price closed and crossed BB
15:24 monaghai: My chart is not refreshing. what should i do?
15:24 MTS1: price closed = you mean prior bars that closed above?
15:24 MTS1: ^Shaun
15:24 MTS1: Mona; restart tos or call support
15:24 monaghai: I did hat
15:24 monaghai: that
15:24 monaghai: even restarted system
15:24 Shaun11: I'm looking for the current bar, which crosses BB
15:25 bob: time on all charts ends at 14:42 ... frozen. tried reset to defaults. turn off and on any suggestions?
15:27 MTS1: And support was not able to help you Monag?
15:27 bob: fixed itself - good night
15:27 MTS1: I'll look at the script Shaun, but assumed it was doing that.
15:27 Joebone87: Hey AI.. or MT or anyone really.. 
if you were going to hold a portfolio of 10 ish names with highish div yeild.. avg of 3.75 - 4.2..  there are 300+ names to pick from in this list.
http://tos.mx/tfGIRj#
if you were going to model a portfolio and hold 10 of these names on technical and maybe the limited fundamental stats we have in thinkscript.  how would you do it.
I was thinking something as limited as roll positions on a quarterly basis and roll into whatever did best on a rolling 6month and 3month averaged average?
any experience advice jumping into something like this?
15:28 monaghai: thanks It worked
15:29 Joebone87: thanks in advance for any input.. ill share if it turns into anything worth sharing
15:31 Ky: K
15:33 MTS1: Shaun; have you tried it live? A chart is updated live; as a bar crosses above BB it should signal, but if it crosses back and closes below the (historical) arow plot will go away. But an alert would have gone off as it crossed the first time on that bar.
15:35 MTS1: No custom script would be able to do this differently as you'd have to use the same function.
15:35 MTS1: Only option then would be to go use a lower timeframe and change the BB plots / alerts to imitate  the higher aggregation. 
15:39 MTS1: Joe; probably more for AI or JQ. But what is your goal, and what's more important? (Highest div possible vs total capital appriciation incl dividends so lower risk of price declines? Etc).
15:41 Vimes: Joe, if you are sticking just to the technical side, one option you can try is a momentum strategy of the best performing stocks over your lookback period
15:44 Shaun11: MTS1:I'm looking exactly a you mentioned ."           as a bar crosses above BB it should signal, but if it crosses back and closes below the (historical) arow plot will go away. But an alert would have gone off as it crossed the first time on that bar.
15:45 Shaun11: Currently the market is very slow to make a move above BB. I'll tet and let you know
15:47 Shaun11: MTS1 : Any suggestion on the second condition : when the bar length(the difference of low and high) is greater than 10 pips.
15:48 Shaun11: for Forex price
15:52 MTS1: Did not see that before. Not familiar with Forex / Pips; but should be easy to add in; need to add something to the signal condition like "AND high-low>10"; just not sure if 10 would be 10 pips in this case, or if you use 100 or something else instead of 10.
15:53 amalia: (High-Low)>=(TickSize()*10) is my guess
15:53 MTS1: bbib
16:04 bigworm: so today was like just joking kind of day
16:04 bigworm: in /es
16:04 bigworm: short cover
16:08 FrankB3: Does Trader_TV freeze your whole computer,, lately ????
16:08 OpInfantry: Would anyone be able to help me with the MACD crossover centerline scan?
16:09 OpInfantry: I want to run a scan for whent the AVG crosses either above or below the centerline.
16:15 MTS1: the center line is just a 20 SMA
16:15 MTS1: so scan for crossing an SMA
16:19 MTS1: Sorry; totally miss-read that in my mind
16:19 amalia: Macd().Avg crosses 0
16:19 amalia: ? idk
16:21 MTS1: You're really looking for the avg (second plot) to cross 0, not the primary MACD plot (value)?
16:21 Shaun11: Amalia , MTS1 thank you. Let me try that condition, see if it works.
16:22 MTS1: In any case; the MACD obviously is a built-in study; you can build that condition in the scan condition builder.
16:22 MTS1: *Condition Wizard
16:31 MTS1: Guess we lost the infantry;)
16:32 amalia: Guess so
16:32 amalia: Trader Lounge has an interesting convo though. Lady lost 500k or something like that.
16:34 MTS1: But she had low margin interest and low commissions. . .
16:39 Vimes: that's hard to believe, but if true, man feel really bad for her
16:40 Shaun11: Amalia., MTS1 : I tried the following in a 2 minute FOREX chart.but not triggering,       (High-Low)>=(TickSize()*1) True.
16:41 amalia: Not what I had suggested. Scroll up and compare
16:43 MTS1: I don't really Vimes; I mean I'm sorry for her, but she made her bed. Got advice this AM and still ignored it. She herself stated she has a gabling issue. Not sure why a gambler would go in all-in with all their possessions on one color on the roulette table; but guess she put it on one stock. Not sure how leverage played into this; she's not clear. Lot's of traders started as gambling and had to lose it to start paying attention and learn first; she may be great down the road;)
16:44 MTS1: Shaun; that does not look like a chart script; do you have a plot or something?
16:44 MTS1: Thought it was in combination with the BB crossover?
16:45 MTS1: Where in TOS are you trying to use this; are you biulding a script in charts with a plot / arrows etc, or are you building an alert in MarketWatch, or something else?
16:45 Shaun11: MTS1 First I wanted to test the bar lenght alone, if that works. I have that script in the sturdy alert
16:46 MTS1: OK; so you have a standalone script? What is the rest of hte script?
16:47 amalia: Share the script.
16:47 MTS1: Best way to test even an alert script is to put it on a chart; move it to a lower panel, and if it's a boolean condition plot you'll see the spikes when the condition was true and an alert was triggered.
16:49 MTS1: A script on a chart has to have a ";" at the end of a line, and needss a plot. So in  your case it might be: plot signal = (High-Low)>=TickSize(); which would always be true and should plot a horizontal line at 1, or ticksize * 10 for your original condition, and you'll see spikes when it would have triggered. .  
16:49 MTS1: gtg bbl
16:51 Shaun11: from market watch I have slected a forex pair with 2 minute. then selected Stud Alert. I have added condition with as (High-Low)>=(TickSize()*1), selected trigger if : True. on the set Alert Rules, I have checked reverse cross over and Bell Sound alert. then create Alert
16:52 MTS1: it never reverse crosses as it is always true like that; follow my suggestion and try it on a chart.
17:00 Shaun11: MTS1: are you suggesting me to create a study with code: plot signal = (High-Low)>=TickSize()*10 and then add that study on the chart?
17:13 neo_theone: #
# Shaun click the beaker icon and press create
# a window will open paste this code in it
# on the bottom right click OK button
# click another OK button in the beaker icon or studies window
# your study is now added to the chart
# BTW the study seems to have little value, it will trigger a lot and will also trigger at the most inopportune moments. you might want to rethink your study
plot signal = (High-Low)>=TickSize()*10 ;
def up = crosses (High-Low, TickSize()*10, crossingDirection.ABOVE) ;
AddVerticalLine(up, "up "+round(close,2), color.GREEN, curve.POINTS);
Alert(up, "up "+round(close,2), alert.BAR, Sound.BELL);
17:15 neo_theone: shaun try this link for tons of excellent  studies

17:33 amalia: Resize image to 600x600 then BEFORE hitting Send, right-hand click on image and downsize to 10%. The audience can size to 100% if they want a bigger view, so as not to take up the buffer space.
17:34 Shaun11: thank you Amalia. let me try
17:38 Shaun11:    Hello Neo. I tried your code. I see just a line 
17:39 MTS1: drag it lower panel
17:40 MTS1: it toggles between 0&1, false & true
17:41 mcdon0301: hey so. it's a tall request because the product is considered hocus pocus. I can't seem to finish it. anyone interested in seeing the solar system?    http://tos.mx/AU4i0G#
17:42 mcdon0301: it's not a simple script, but interesting none the less
17:45 mcdon0301: the calcuations into the remaining planets are far different
17:45 Shaun11: MTS1, drag it lower panel ??. sorry. Im new.
17:46 amalia: Shaun11, have you gone through a platform tour?
17:51 Shaun11: yes Amelia.
17:53 amalia: I would schedule another through support@thinkorswim.com and before the tour, write down 10+ questions/inquiries to ask about.
17:53 Shaun11: MTS1. I dont see 0&1 on my chart. any way Can we change the script to provideonly sound  sound alert, when bar lenght is greate than 10 pips.
17:54 amalia: Alert((High-Low)>(TickSize()*10));
17:54 amalia: disclaimer: coding in chat. might get errors
17:54 amalia: Shaun11, which ticker/symbol do you mostly trade or want this alert?
17:55 Shaun11: forex pair EUR/USD
17:56 amalia: Thanks mcdon0301. Intersting study.
17:59 mcdon0301: no problem. not sure it's useful , though.
18:01 amalia: Why do you have it the study?
18:04 amalia: Shaun11, what timeframe are you looking at?
18:06 Shaun11: Amalia :actually I needed on 15 min when the bar length is great than 10 pips but for testing I'm using the study on 2 min with TickSize()*2
18:06 amalia: huh
18:06 amalia: Ok, before we begin this rabbit hole. HOW exactly does this make you money?
18:07 mcdon0301: my interest in harmonics lead me to L. Pesavento. he asserts some interesting facts about the affects of planet positions on people. His main point was quite logical - the main cycle is our solar system. just interested and had time so..
18:10 amalia: Read The Delta Phenomenon by Welles Wilder
18:11 neo_theone: hi otto long time no see how is everything
18:11 mcdon0301: according to LP, it isn't a timing tool. more just dates to be cognizant of.  most likely a load stuff
18:13 mcdon0301: thanks. i will read it.
18:13 MTS1: Shaun, if you add a line to the script it will be added on the lower panel when you add it to your chart: declare lower;
18:14 MTS1: or you can drag it in the window where you edit the scripts on your chart
18:14 mcdon0301: whats your useful takeaway from the book?
18:16 otto2000: hi neo... was in canada for a while... cold... cold... cold... back in CA now
18:16 otto2000: still working on my script...
18:16 otto2000: 5 years now
18:16 MTS1: McDon; so you didn't ask alpha?
18:17 neo_theone: sope you had fun. CA is much nicer
18:17 neo_theone: hope
18:17 otto2000: it is nice there, too.... only colder
18:18 neo_theone: yes but i am allergic to cold
18:18 neo_theone: your script is very good
18:18 neo_theone: you will finish it
18:19 mcdon0301: i see. amalia. well try this. divide saturn's longdeg by 24 then use it as a rotating length for any average. Even though correlation isn't causation, it is a little crazy when you test correlation.
18:19 amalia: Didn't get much of it other than a moon phase script http://tos.mx/VAnFaX#
18:19 otto2000: gdetting closer to pulling the trigger with /YM
18:19 neo_theone: thats awesome otto
18:19 amalia: 783 buysignal, otto.
18:20 mcdon0301: thanks!!
18:20 otto2000: thanks amalia... I am trying to create long/short signals
18:20 neo_theone: amalia dont you think that moon phases and planets use is hocus pocus [even around halloween]
18:21 otto2000: neo: of course...
18:21 amalia: Correlation isn't causation neo
18:21 neo_theone: lol yes
18:23 mcdon0301: amalia, was that the same script you shared last night?
18:24 mcdon0301: i'm around stats guys all day. can't help it :/
18:25 amalia: No.
18:27 mcdon0301: just making sure i'm somewhat sane still
18:47 amalia: lol
18:54 Vimes: yeah cause this is the sane group
18:55 amalia: It is. You should try some of the other rooms. We maintain ourselves here if you see what's in the other rooms.
18:55 amalia: For a while, we would be the only room open afterhours until people started noticing then using it as the RomperRoom afterdark. Room hours changed shortly after that.
18:56 Shaun11: neo: I can see that your code logic working fine with 0&1 for true and false. but the sound.bell alert seems not working.                                                                                     plot signal = (High-Low)>=TickSize()*10 ;
#AddVerticalLine(up, "up "+round(close,2), color.GREEN, curve.POINTS);
18:56 Vimes: yep the trader lounge is a bit of a zoo
18:58 Shaun11: neo:Also is it possible to change the 0&1 to an arrow on top of the bar, when it is true
19:14 alx: Hello, Is it possible to calcualte yesterdays aftermarket volume?
19:14 alx: in a TOS script
19:47 admin_tculs: thinkScript Lounge chatroom will be closing soon   Please finish all conversations by 8pm ct  Have a nice evening
19:57 John1a: mcdon0301: Do you have a script that does this Saturn thingy? I've read a study some time ago about a correlation with the Moon phases. Wasn't yesterday a full moon? Full moon should be bullish, new moon bearish, we did get a rally this time, but would be interesting to backtest it.
------- Friday, October 26, 2018 -------
07:13 Mobius: GM - I see from the discussion last night that this chat room may be turning to the Dark Side.  When we go back to divining stock direction from the phases of the moon or planets or any such astrology we fail as thinking programmers, traders or even people and revert to the dark ages mentality. No reason just reaction. 
07:14 bkstrader: GM Mobius
07:32 John1a: Or maybe we're just having an open mind: https://www.screencast.com/t/FZZOPJEJ Moon phases and solar activity affects human and animal bahavior, which is why they publish Moon and Solar calendars for hunters.
07:33 neo_theone: Shaun the alert will work at the "BAR" when your condition is met, you need to wait for the next signal. not that it matters but  in my opinion you need to look at mobius studies, right click on his name if he is in the room. any who
07:33 neo_theone: #

07:45 AlphaInvestor: I am glad that MacDon added another script to my April Fools collection
07:49 Mobius: Fools being the operative word
07:50 Mobius: John for some things an open mind is just a dirty hole to fall into
07:50 ttl: One of the best stories I've read about spurious correlations was how butter production in Bangladesh  matched SP performance almost perfectly.  An economist searched UN data until it matched the SP with a very high R squared.  After he published his "findings" people would write to him asking for updates and predictions for the market.
07:51 Mobius: lol
07:55 Mobius: I think the butter index would be as good or better than the astrology index
07:55 Vimes: all these varying ideas is what makes the market work
07:55 Vimes: to some extent ;)
07:55 Mobius: No Vimes it's what makes most people lose
07:56 Vimes: i didn't impy profit in loss, i'm just saying somebodies, determination of when to buy versus when to sell, the time frame of one trader versus the time frame of another, on an on
07:57 Mobius: Why do so many look for an indicator rather than do the work to find worthwhile investments.
07:58 Vimes: good question, again, my guess has to do with time frame - my 401k i'm never plotting or putting an indicator on for exmaple
07:59 Mobius: You work your life to save mony or get a once in a lifetime inheritance then trust it to some indicator that you've no idea how, when or why it works or doesn't
07:59 AlphaInvestor: Indicators are easy; work, well it is hard Work
08:00 ttl: It's at least plausable compared to lunar cycles;  if the economy is growing in Bangladesh and butter output is up, then the US economy should be growing too.  I'll stay away from the growing academic scandel of non-replication and p-hacking just to get something to publish.  Just like getting any indicator to match  a chart.
08:00 Vimes: well i wasn't not trying to say or determine the usefulness of any on eparticular indicator over another - but more that all the market particpants that bring whatever they have cooked up is what makes markets work - if everyone trades the exact same way would it still work?
08:02 Mobius: sorry Vimes.. Wasn't addressing you directly.  Just an old mans rant
08:02 Vimes: i know that, i got tough skin
08:03 Mobius: /ES GlobeX over 500,000. Should be a good trading day
08:05 Mobius: Price in about the middle of the range so no opening trade bias to me. Will trade the break of the first 15min bar.
08:06 mthfr_vaxxed: /ES had a catalyst on the 4th too..... another one.
08:07 mthfr_vaxxed: china hack is a big deal....and we dont even know if its true!
08:08 Vimes: Apple claims they have no evidence of the claim
08:08 Mobius: Consumer Sentiment at the hour after open.
08:08 MTS1: OK; my first'original' to share; or at least original to me as I've not seen  this idea before: 
08:09 MTS1: # Name: MTS_BarTrend
# MTS1808 Assign Price Color based on price trend compared to prior bar(s)
# v1810
# Share Link: http://tos.mx/GrgdYr#
# Decided that it was kinda arbitrary to decide 'up' vs 'down' candle / color based on random point in time between bars, only comparing close vs open. So thought of alternative based on the idea that higher highs / lows indicate an uptrend, versus the reverse. 
# This BarTrend uses idea of defining up candles as having higher high / low than previous candle, and reverse for down candles. 'Inside Bars' are considered neutral / compression and have their own color. 
# It also incorporates optional 'Dynamic Higher TimeFrame' Dynamic Range; combining prior x candles to determing if new candle has both a higher high and lower low than prior x candles combined highest highs / lows. Any subsequent candles are also considered 'inside bars' or compression area if not exceeding either the high or low of the HT combined HT 'candle'. 
# Declare lower; for trend plot
Input nTrend = 10; #Hint nTrend: Trend Lookback n Bars
Input HTBC = 2; #Hint HTBC: Number of prior candles to combine Dynamic 'Higher TimeFrame Prior Candle'
Def o = open;
Def h = High;
Def l = Low;
Def c = close;

# plot Rg =  (IBRg);
# Rg.SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.VALUES_ABOVE);
def NB = B>IBRg;
Def U = !NB and (l>=HTl[1] and h>=HTh[1]);
Def D = !NB and (h<=HTh[1] and l<=HTl[1]);
Def EU = !NB and (h>HTh[1] and l<HTl[1] and 2*(h-c)<c-l); #Engulfing -  Count as UP Bar 
Def ED = !NB and (l<HTl[1] and h>HTh[1] and h-c>2*(c-l)); #Engulfing -  Count as DOWN Bar

08:09 MTS1: Included full script otherwise Mobius would not read;)
08:09 Vimes: lol, thanks MT will check out later today
08:10 mthfr_vaxxed: All the people who claim its not true are people who wouldn't be aware even if it was true..... otherwise it wouldn't be an investigation...it would be a public inquiry
08:10 MTS1: Was interesting exersise for me, not as 'simple' as originally thought, especially figuring out the compression / neutral bars. In any case; any feedback on the indicator or the code is appreciated. .
08:11 Vimes: AAPL wouldn't be aware?  I don't want to be naive, but at the same time would imagine they woudl have some of the formeost experts in the space
08:14 mthfr_vaxxed: and if hardware engineers found it.... you think they whole company would be notified? did google notify us when they were hacked? did equifax?
08:15 Mobius: Finding code lines that don't belong know as bad smell is not near as hard as finding hardware the doesnn't belong. One has copies that can be compared. The other has blueprints that don't always compare. The test for hardware is - Does it signal as it was designed to or better not does it move the electrons in the path it was designed to.
08:18 alx: Hello, Is it possible to calculate prev day's after-market volume in a TOS script?
08:18 Mobius: So it's not hard to see how getting the hardware through on a first run could happen. It would be far more unlikely for that to happen once in production. But on a first run with approval now that chip is the norm until someone gets alerted.
08:20 Mobius: alx - sure
08:21 Mobius: alx - Manual - GetTime(),  RegularTradingEnd(), RegularTradingStart()
08:22 MTS1: yes but everyone involves denies it, the reported chip and location don't make sense, no access to communication lines. And malicious traffic should be able to be sniffed out and proven especially once 'known' like now.
08:22 MTS1: ^Regarding hardware hack
08:22 alx: @Mobius,  I tried to use them but earliest they grab volume is 00:00 I need to start from prev day 16:00
08:23 Mobius: alx - keep trying and you will succeed
08:24 Vimes: alx, look at all the date/time functions, you can slice the volume however you want
08:24 Mobius: MTS1 - isn't that what happened. They found the traffic. Just not prior to production.
08:26 Mobius: As far as denial - well that's just human nature.
08:26 Mobius: lie when the truth makes more sense.  Got a man elected as president so it must work
08:28 Mobius: Time to get focused  
08:28 MTS1: I'm not sure we know the whole picture Mobius; the whole thing may be made up to make China look bad, or to warn about what could happen and to improve our channels. I read some stuff after the initial news that took that information and debunked it; but I'm not sure what realy is going on and what is 'fake'.
08:29 MTS1: It's certainly a possibility that can happen, but this particular story may not be true.
08:29 MTS1: or accurate I should say
08:29 Mobius: Truth - What is Truth
08:36 Farmin: ummm, what the lawyers say?   the opposite of what the lawyers say?
08:37 mthfr_vaxxed: markets dont care about truth. they care about hype.
08:38 mthfr_vaxxed: i think mr. bloomberg just made some major money this month
08:39 Farmin: and stirred up at least one whole industry
08:41 mthfr_vaxxed: plus Q was posting pictures of servers months ago.... i actually think this is real
08:43 mthfr_vaxxed: supply chain weaknesses
09:03 Mobius: Finally a breakout
09:05 mthfr_vaxxed: 70% shorting ATT so far
09:05 Mobius: Moving RO stop to the Prob Move 2650
09:06 Mobius: actual RO hit
09:06 Mobius: Fast market
09:06 Mobius: Runner stp still Prob Move
09:15 mthfr_vaxxed: can i see options in the scanner based off filters for the stock? or i can only filter based off option stats?
09:16 Vimes: i think in the options hacker you can add only stock filters
09:17 Vimes: meaning exclusively, you can also add options filters
09:20 Mobius: closed runner 2650
09:21 Mobius: Got some errands to run. Later traders
09:29 SuperBall: Are analyst ratings data on the platform, like looking to go with analyst call or fade them.
09:33 MTS1: yep
09:34 MTS1: not in TS though, but in TOS
09:36 SuperBall: thx.
09:41 mthfr_vaxxed: thats lame... i wanna filter on stocks.... then use those stocks and further filter on options... can do that in TOS?
09:42 MTS1: yep
09:43 MTS1: you can use a dynamic watchlist (saved query) as input for the next scan by scanning against that list.
09:43 MTS1: can get multiple levels deep if you like
09:44 MTS1: but there really is no difference between stock and option hacker; all stock filters are avilale in option hacker also
09:45 MTS1: (and vice versa)
09:47 mthfr_vaxxed: oh ok. got it working now. thanks
09:48 MTS1: yw
09:48 FenderBlender: Does anyone have a thinkscript from the open today to the current underlying price?
09:48 MTS1: be specific Fender
09:49 FenderBlender: I want to determine the %change from today's open (the default is from yesterday's close)
09:49 Farmin: close-open on a daily agg
09:49 FenderBlender: I want to add this value to a Walchlist column
09:50 FenderBlender: Open to current.  I.e.  if it opened at $10 and now is at $11... I want to see %Change as 10%
09:50 Farmin: close is current, fender
09:52 MTS1: Set the column to daily (default anyway) and put in the math formula.
09:52 FenderBlender: Currently, %Change shows change since close.  So, if it closed at $9... opened at $10... and is currently at $11 it show's %Change as %20.  I want it to show 10% since it only changed 10% today
09:52 MTS1: Finish what Farmin started earlier; he alsready answered
09:54 FenderBlender: Close-Open on daily agg?
09:54 MTS1: right, and finish that
09:54 MTS1: (close-open)/close *100 would be the math formula you're looking for right?
09:55 Jowy: hello guys, my watchlist column is showing something "custom expression subscription limit exceeded" what is that?
09:55 FenderBlender: I see now, so, 'close' = current.  I didn't realise that.  Thanks! 
------- Thursday, October 25, 2018 -------
10:16 Mobius: Jowy - TOS data is free so they put a limit on how much you can use. You've hit your limit. Delete some watchlists, charts or whatever it takes to get below the limit
10:16 MTS1: Jowy; TDA limits amount of free data; reduce custom watchlist columnts, watchlist size, or number of scripts on charts or charts.

vaxx
10:34 MTS1: Barefoot; can look at VWAP for example
10:35 profit_recon: hey guys anyone have suggestion for study that would be useful for wave counts or something similiar to elliott wave or pivots base on candle action within time period rather than daily weekly or monthly?
10:36 Farmin: lwe, ToS does not generally support thinkscript triggering actual trades.  the exception is the use of very simple codes in Conditional Orders
10:36 MTS1: lwe? You can use TS to test strategies on chart and report. Limited conditional order TS capabiity to use to trigger orders; test as MarketWatch alerts which has the same limitations: If you get reliable alerts when expected you should be able to use as conditional order script.
10:38 barefoot: got it.  Thx Mobius and MTS1.
10:39 Farmin: profit, play with the zigzag script.  may not be exactly what you are looking for, but it is what exists
10:41 lwe1: So no algo trading with TOS using ThinkScript?
10:42 Farmin: NOPE
10:43 lwe1: Thank You
10:44 profit_recon: @farmin thanks will check
10:49 Daytrader71: good afternoon guys, looking for some help on a script , Parabolic Sar when crossover to support and "di" positive crossover over "di" negative will give the buy signal.�After the buy signal is given.�Stop order will be set 2 points from entry price. ( Please make this adjustable so I can tweak)Exit signal will be when Parsar crossover to resistance and whenever "di" negative crossover "di" positive to confirm sell.Would like to see the "Buy" , "Stop", "Exit" on chart if possible.
10:49 Daytrader71: any help is appreciated!
10:54 Jowy: Thanks MTS1!
10:58 Farmin: lose the bold italics
11:02 Daytrader71: sorry about that I had it written and when I copy I guess it was bold in writing
11:03 Daytrader71: ok thanks
11:03 Ben: Thanks mobius will do
11:06 Daytrader71: Good afternoon, 
11:09 Daytrader71: parabolic sar when crossover to support and "di"  positive crossover over the "Di" Negative will give a buy signal. Stop order will be set 2 pts below entry entry. (Please make this adjustable so I can tweak) Exit signal will be when parar sar crossover to resistance and "di" positive crossover to negative to sell. Would like to see "Buy" "Stop", "Sell" on chart if possible. Thanks.
11:09 Mobius: Daytrader - Copy and paste both those studies to a new strategy. the change the plot lines to def lines of code. The add the buy and sell orders with the conditions you want
11:10 Mobius: hmm my n key must have peanut butter in it
11:11 Mobius: Daytrader - exit the room and reenter to reset your font. White font doesnt show on a white background
11:11 Daytrader71: Mobius. thanks. do you know where I can go to learn the script better?
11:12 Mobius: always best to start with the manual so you don't blow your new toy up - http://tlc.thinkorswim.com/center/charting/thinkscript.html
11:17 Mobius: Big Picture Stuff:  /ES bouced right off the lower Long Term Balance area set starting in last Feb.  And has broken below trend support lines. Wake me up when we hit $2550
 
11:25 Vimes: Mobius has the best toys
11:25 Paris: Daytrader - this is actually the best place to learn about ThinkScript, it may take some time but like many of us, you'll get there. Take care
11:30 Lei: Anyone with feelings about YERX
11:36 Mobius: On track for a 4mil cont day for /ES. That could make today the second biggest of the year. 4.7mil is the title holder  
11:37 Mobius: If we go green the urge to climb on board the rally train may turn into a stampede
11:38 Vimes: from markets in turmoil to a market rally
11:38 Paris: I for one will be really keen to see the EWI short term forecasts (due after the close today).
11:39 SuperBall: are there other indicators similar to or better than the ATR?
11:41 Mobius: better for what?
11:41 Mobius: ATR == AverageTrueRange.  It is what it is
11:42 Vimes: keltner channels, bol bands, guess all depends on use
11:42 mcdon0301: mobius. is your balance prive always set to to length 4 weekly?
11:43 SuperBall: tell me if the range are getting smaller, for scalping.
11:43 Mobius: You can modify it by a price filter such as HeikenAshi or a polynomial filter like Laguerre or a normalized price filter like Gaussian
11:43 SuperBall: maybe speed too.
11:44 Mobius: Super.. The only way to make it any faster is to shorten the length being compared.
11:45 SuperBall: run two charts?  how about taking the derivative?
11:47 Mobius: ok what will that do for you?
11:47 SuperBall: Mobius, what do you make of the /es run from late last year to january compared to the recent rally, before these two rallies falthered?  the two peaks strength looks to be divergent.
11:48 SuperBall: measure the speed of the ATR, if calculus can be done does it make sense?
11:50 Mobius: Super.. your measuring absolute points in a time series. You either modify that series length or the points being measured. It's just that simple. I've already told you above how to do that
11:51 SuperBall: okay, i'll figure it out, thank you.
11:51 Mobius: nothing to figure out. All those suggestions are already coded by me and in MyTrade
11:52 Vimes: Super, just out of personal curiosity i've always though of expanding volatility as the opportunity what about a narrowing ATR would you scalp?
11:56 SuperBall: the ATR gets bigger as the volatility/range expands, as the price range narrows the indicator trends down whether the price goes up/down/sideways.
11:57 SuperBall: so i am thinking to avoid scalping when it narrows.
11:57 Vimes: k thx
11:58 Mobius: Super - look at the ECI (Expansion Contraction Indicator) on MyTrade
11:59 Mobius: It plots a channel marking areas of volatility compression
11:59 SuperBall: i can't take the derivative of a constant, it would just be zero. lol.
11:59 Vimes: well the atr is not a consant, just not sure what hte rate of change would tell you, plot it and see
12:00 SuperBall: Okay, I will look for it.  Thanks Mobius.
12:00 Mobius: yw
12:00 Vimes: maybe trade at the invlection
12:00 Vimes: inflection
12:01 poseidon77: Trying to plot AccountNetLiq but it always returns N/A .... what am I doing wrong?
12:02 Mobius: Problem with any volatility squeeze is knowing which way it will break out. It's common for price to breakout of a compression one way just to turn in a few bars and go the other way.
12:16 DMonkey: Atr volume rank percentage. Hahaha
12:16 John1a: Moon shot reversal, pun intended :)
12:17 bmckinney: How do I make a script in my scanner settings that says something like,
 "close is within 5% of the 20 day high  OR  close is within 5% of the 50 day high"  
I want to be able to give that option to choose instead of creating a separate scanner.
12:19 Nube: RE volatility, not ready yet but the abnormal volatility idea combined with FE might have potential
12:22 Vimes: BM, check the built in price_change study/filter on the scanner
12:25 Mobius: This Study plots Flags, Compression Areas, Shelves, Balance Areas about as fast and cleanly as I've seen
#hint: Expansion Contraction Indicator (ECI): \n ECI Identifies areas of price compression which leads to price expansion. ECI doesn't show the direction of a trend but does indicate when a trend is going to resume (price flagging) or if a change in trend polarity is happening.\n ECI plots the areas where price becomes compressed with colored and clouded bands. The indicator also leaves legacy points in areas of past compression.
# ECI is based on the FE algorithm 
# Original plot style by Mobius
# Note: Default Lengths are not optimized. My personal experience has been length ranges between 8 and 13 are generally effective.
# Here's another way to look at Fractal Energy. This study plots it on the chart graph with clouded areas for the current price compression, exhaustion area and leaves colored points as a legacy plot for past areas.
# Good CSA choices with this study are:
# ECI + SuperTrend + Fractal Pivots
# ECI + SuperTrend + RSI in Laguerre Time
# ECI + SuperTrend + Standard Deviation Bands
# ECI + Linear Regression Standard Deviation Bands
# This version Modified to filter price to a normalized distribution

12:29 Lei: Sorry YEXT
12:30 Vimes: try the trader forum Lei
12:31 Lei: Thank you.
12:36 Mobius: I've added tha above study to MyTrade. Leaving room fo 2 more studies. And I still need 14 more to make 1,000 followers.
12:41 bkstrader: Now its 13 Mobius you have great scripts
12:42 neo_theone: mobius i was looking at the /ES after your wake up call. is it  correct that it started down on oct 3, after it tried to mach 9/21 high and it couldnt (may be butter was melting in the heat)
12:44 bmckinney: Vimes: Price_Change doesn't tell me near highs
12:49 decoder: hi, i use the obv "on balance volume" on the chart, how can i displace it so it wont be on top of the candles? anybody?
12:52 Mobius: neo... That's a polarity change from /ES setting new higher highs and higher lows to new lower highs and lower lows.
12:53 Mobius: decoder add a plot line well above an OBV high and that will push it down
12:53 neo_theone: thankyou
12:58 decoder: thanks Mobious  ill try that but i really want to displace it forward or backward a few periods.
13:00 Mobius: decoder - Sorry that doesn't compute.
13:01 decoder: thanks!
13:02 Mobius: If you copy and paste the TOS native study to a new study and want to use that lower study on the upper chart you have to add a plot line that will be well above the original oscillator in order to push the oscillator down below the candles
13:03 Mobius: That added plot line can be drawn the same color as your background color so that it doesn't show
13:06 decoder: thanks Mobious ill try that :)
13:07 Paris: FrankB3 - Just cleared the chat logs for the past 2 days and noticed your post regarding cycle studies. Sounds like Mobius may be posting some cycle studies in due course (according to his comment yesterday). You might like to wait for that. If not, contact me offline as I'm in the midst of a house move and may not be actively monitoring the chat
13:10 Vimes: BM, sorry there is another one then that is near high and lows, if not you can easliy code a custom one
13:12 Vimes: Just takes some digging,
13:26 sassy911: Can you put more than one price time frame on a single chart? 20 min and 60 min.
13:26 Vimes: Decoder, if you are talking about the paint order, the last study in each panel gets painted last or overlays the other
13:40 JohnnyQuotron: Mobius... the ECI you posted today.. it is quite different from other ECI scripts of yours which i have in the OneNote.   It looks to me to have a Gaussian Filter.  Is that correct?  and are there other changes which I should note?  Thank you.Please feel free to reply  after the close if that would be better for you.
13:43 3x_: question about using TOS:
13:44 3x_: is there a way to temporarily hide all lines, studies, drawings?
13:45 Vimes: style/settings/show studies, you can add it as a quick select on the style menu
13:45 3x_: hoping there's a modifier key or combination press-and-hold on a chart to see it without any of my overlays — just for a sec at a time
13:51 Mobius: Like Dad used to say hope and wish in one hand and spit in the other. Which gets full faster?
13:52 Mobius: Johnny.. Yes price is filtered on that study to move it to a normalized range.  Notes are in the study header also.
13:53 Mobius: That is the only study of that sort I actually use. It's also one of my favorites.
13:58 Mobius: We have well over 100 points of travel in /ES today. Starting to feel like just a touch of volatility is back
14:02 Nube: That filter was too good to give away. I'm not giving it back though. I use it in everything now.
14:09 JohnnyQuotron: Mobius.. thank you.  A point of clarification.. you prefer this measure of FE to the Gaussed plot of FE in the RSI-Laguerre with Gaussian Filter?
14:09 Nube: I lied, haven't found it's use for volune yet
14:15 JohnnyQuotron: Inappropriate market comment...  this kind of action makes perfect sense when P/Es OVER adjust to lower earnings growth rate projections in the "Out" years vs next year.  (2020 EPS growth < 2019 EPS growth.   What's the right multiple? )
14:19 Nube: Whatever multiple gets es to 5k
14:19 Mobius: Johnny - I use an RSI Laguerre also Gaussian Filtered. What I like about the study posted earlier today is the way it identifies flags quickly and plots a channel that expands to indicate a probable breakout
14:21 JohnnyQuotron: Agreed.   I find the visual of the eci preferrable as well.  It "speaks" to me more clearly than the FE plot in the RSI Laguerre with Gaussian FIlter.
14:21 Vimes: it is a beauty
14:21 Mobius: Example:  /ES  just hit the Implied move formed a flag then moved up toward the Probable move. Giving context to price action
14:22 JohnnyQuotron: one more question  are you watching/trading 5min or 2min /es today?  
14:22 Mobius: 2
14:23 Vimes: yeah who doesn't like 12 point scalps
14:24 cajun: Mobius looks like we'll end w SPX having a double "inside day'. do u read this set up as a probable reversal for monday?
14:24 Mobius: trading 60 points on intraday is kinda nice. Too bad it's not every day.
14:25 Mobius: cajun - /ES is a continuation day not inside. I always refer to /ES and never SPX
14:26 JohnnyQuotron: ty..  
14:26 Mobius: As to Monday - Too much possible news for me to even guess
14:26 cajun: oooh.  thx Mobius
14:27 Vimes: spx, though is not an inside day
14:29 Mobius: yeah  SPX is also a continuation day
14:29 JohnnyQuotron: vs wednesday?
13:02 Nube: bk, how hard would it be to delete the minus sign and try it.
13:03 bkstrader: Just did Nube no luck
13:03 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current.
13:05 JohnnyQuotron: Question.. has anyone scripted a scan for the Gaussian Self Adjusting RSI Laguerre with FE?  I will try if not.
13:09 JohnnyQuotron: bks.  trouble shoot.. try a bubble with just the adx...  then try another with just the other variable data one by one  create debug labels for each bit of variable data you want in the bubble.  
13:09 Nube: bk, did you use the incorrect syntax that is in the post at :03?
13:09 JohnnyQuotron: Is the bubble in the proper xy location?
13:10 anees: hello , is there a way to get the floor pivot points, i get the pre programmed pivots and they arent accurate thanks
13:10 Nube: If you use the correct syntax and index the y value back the same distance you index the x value, you will have data
13:10 JohnnyQuotron: anees check mobius my trade or the community one note

13:13 bkstrader: Nube That gives me anothe direction to try
13:14 JohnnyQuotron: debug the variables one at a time in the bubble. Trust Nube
13:14 bkstrader: JQ I know , Nube has helped may times in the past
13:15 anees: i dont get what i am supposed to do here
13:15 anees: but thank you
13:15 JohnnyQuotron: anees
13:15 JohnnyQuotron: which method
13:15 JohnnyQuotron: which source
13:16 anees: i dont know all i know its called floor pivot points , i saw they were pretty accurate and wanted to ask if they are available for tos because i already have them on DAS
13:17 JohnnyQuotron: are you in the onenote?
13:17 JohnnyQuotron: are you in mobius mytrade?
13:17 anees: yeah
13:18 JohnnyQuotron: which
13:18 anees: one note
13:19 JohnnyQuotron: support resistance section?
13:19 anees: ok
13:20 anees: oh i see them
13:20 JohnnyQuotron: 2. Pivot Scripts... there are 30 of them  Floor Trader Pivots may be a place to start
13:21 anees: yeah im gonna try all of them
13:21 anees: thank you so much
13:21 JohnGalt82: Hi - Wondering if this is built in TOS or has been shared.  Looking to plot swing lines that cross back and forth over a moving average
13:21 JohnnyQuotron: that's what its there for.  Hope you find what ou want. :)
13:22 anees: thanbks johnny appreciate it pal
13:22 JohnnyQuotron: may the code be with you...
13:30 sugar: does anyone know how to use the scan for donchian? I want to scan the ATRSX with close? or send me a copy of the scan.

13:34 JohnnyQuotron: oops my mistake.. those are strategies.. duh
13:34 sugar: johnnyquotron: it's ok you are already helping me out- so ithere a way?
13:35 Mobius: Johnny - There's an RSI Laguerre in MyTrade. The Gaussian version won't scan - Too Complex
13:35 Mobius: RSI Laguerre Scan in MyTrade
13:35 sugar: Mobius: can you send me the RSI Laguerre scan?
13:36 Mobius: no go get it from MyTrade
13:36 sugar: Mobius: where do you get mytrade?
13:37 sugar: Mobius: is that in think & swim?
13:37 Mobius: Right click ANY uers name and go the profile.
13:37 JohnnyQuotron: Mobius.. yes i have that and use it.  But with many etfs and S&P500 stocks i find the gaussian keeps me in the trade longer.    I'm a huge fan. Wonder if it will scan without the FE component?
13:37 Mobius: nope Johnny it will not
13:41 sugar: Mobius & Johnnyquontron: can I run a scan with donchain (ATRSX) with close?
13:43 JohnnyQuotron: mobius... bummer bummer bummer
13:47 Mobius: Johnny - This will scan.
Something in the scanner has changed since I wrote the original. It wouldn't scan then but I just checked and doesn now.

13:48 Mobius: The scan  reference was to the Study name and main plot crossing 0
13:48 Mobius: 8 returns on the S&P 500
13:49 Mobius: Well that would make a couple thousand TOS traders happy to know.
13:53 JohnnyQs_BackupWks: YOU THE MAN !
13:57 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current.  Thank you Mobius and thank you ToS for updating those scan servers. Wahoo...
13:58 bsinks: This has most likely been asked a bazillion times and if so I'm sorry..........Does any body have a link for a good HOD MOMO scanner for TOS
13:58 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - last time that was shared, it had Nfe of 8, Glenght of 13, BetaDev of 4. Now it is configured 5, 13, 8.
Any specific reason for the change. Symbol used on? aggregation period?
14:02 Mobius: Alpha... Just the way I used it last is all
14:02 chief: sugar, this should work as Donchian buy scan....
input length = 50;
plot buy = high > Highest(high[1], length);
14:04 AlphaInvestor: Thanks mobius - the shape and crossing times change of course - I think this is agreat study, one of the best you have done ... so always interested in how/why it works the way it does.
P.S. the math is beyond me
14:07 Mobius: Alpha.. The latest one I've been working on uses an error correction neuron to set the length for the gaussian filter and RSI time factor. Pretty cool.
14:07 AlphaInvestor: oooh, super cool
14:08 AlphaInvestor: I am short a few physical neurons, so software ones are always beneficial
14:08 Mobius: I'll post it when I'm sure it's working correctly
14:08 AlphaInvestor: Great, thanks!
14:08 AlphaInvestor: If yoiu need beta testers ...
14:08 Mobius: I'm sure the group will have a ball twisting and morphing it :)
14:09 bigworm: neuron?
14:09 AlphaInvestor: I rarely touch your studies, except to change the lipstick, or add debug statement so that I can understand how they work
14:10 Mobius: lol  go back to sleep big... 
14:10 ramesh2599: Is it possible to displaly dynamic vertical line  50 bars back?
14:10 AlphaInvestor: yes
14:11 AlphaInvestor: why, would be an appropriate question tho
14:12 MTS1: Ramesh; use barnumber() function and do the math to determine where 50 bars back is. Or index like IsNan(close)[-50]
14:13 Mobius: Quite a bit of /ES volume swapping hands today with no real movement.
14:13 ramesh2599: I am looking into its relationship with  RSI
14:13 Mobius: let me save you some time - There is no relationship with current RSI and RSI 50 bars back
14:14 MTS1: Ramesh; which relationship with RSI?
14:14 ramesh2599: ok
14:15 Mobius: Other than the Butterfly Effect
14:15 MTS1: But 48 bars may work;)
14:15 ramesh2599: 49 to be exact!
14:15 ramesh2599: Thank you all though!!
14:16 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - that is too simplistic - they will both be between 0 and 100
14:16 bigworm: lol i wasnt sleeping.  been up since 6!! had class today to learn about the kernel trick!!!
14:17 bigworm: seems very useful.  I have been looking at code on classifiers and it seems there are alot of ones that are iterative and you need lots of loops.  with kernels, it appears you only need to go over it once
14:17 bigworm: so computationaly, it appears much more effiecient and easy to swap out
14:17 Mobius: You turned left on your way to Walmart last night and because you didn't turn right an accident happened in Russia that killed the one person that could have saved the planet 40 years from now. But the one person that would save the planet 39 years from now was born because if the same turn you made last night.  True Story. 
14:18 bigworm: lol what?
14:19 Vimes: JD?
14:20 Vimes: i thinke he's illustrating the butterfly effect
14:20 bigworm: great movie
14:22 Mobius: String Theory, Chaos Theory, Quantum Entanglement - Spooky Action at a Distance, whatever everything is connected
14:22 bigworm: agree
14:24 Vimes: is it simlar to the kevin bacon theory
14:24 bigworm: mmm
14:24 AlphaInvestor: I know a guy named Kevin, and I like bacon
14:24 Mobius: ohhh bacon...yum
14:26 Mobius: Did you guys read about the kid that just proved that quantum computers are actually doing quantum stuff?
14:26 AlphaInvestor: bacon infused jack daniels - its a thng ... look it up
14:26 Vimes: i've had bacon in bloody mary's , <-_ not ashamed
14:27 bigworm: whats going on with your brain right now
14:27 Mobius: hmm a breakfast idea
14:27 bigworm: quantum bacon stuff?
14:27 mthfr_vaxxed: urmila mahadev?
14:27 Mobius: yep   grad student
14:27 bigworm: lol
14:27 Mobius: smart girl
14:27 Mobius: she will make a difference
14:28 Mobius: TOS needs to hire her  :)
14:28 bigworm: when will they be out?
14:28 bigworm: probably will be too expensive for me
14:29 Mobius: First Quantum Trading Platform.. You guys paying attention
14:29 Vimes: i think i'm in love
14:29 bigworm: im not quick enough to even use a regular computer that efficiently
14:30 AlphaInvestor: I am stuck on a continuous surface with only one side and only one boundary .. I have no time for such banal persuits
14:31 Mobius: I loved one of the illustrations used to describe a core problem with understanding what a quantum computer is doing. One with 100 qbits held in a single state would take a current harddrive the size of the visible universe to hold it's state data.  
14:33 Mobius: How could any human know if that data is correct??
14:34 mthfr_vaxxed: "Mahadev's protocl is unlikely to be implemented in a real quantum computer in the immediate future. For the time being, the protocol requires too much computing power to be practical."
14:34 Mobius: That young woman found a way... That is cool!
14:34 mthfr_vaxxed: sounds like an expensive "trust" function ....
14:35 Mobius: trust isn't an option
14:35 Mobius: Not unless you thing the Terminator would be a nice buddy
14:36 Mobius: think
14:38 NUG: Since TOS changed the futures symbols, I'm wondering if it is possible to use wildcards in thinkscript to compare with the results of the getSymbol() function??
14:38 Mobius: Why wonder. Use Addlabel and find out
14:38 Vimes: terminator 2, i think he was a nice buddy, been a while though
14:39 NUG: For example: current code is if getSymbol() == "/ES:XCME"
14:39 John1a: Does anyone have a script for the Std Channel in TOS that changes the channels color (green, yellow, red) depending on a trend, up, down, neutral. Thank you.
14:39 NUG: can I use if getSymbol() == "/ES*" ?
14:40 AlphaInvestor: Nug - you can use it, but I don't hink it will work any more
14:41 NUG: belly laugh
14:41 NUG: then why use it?
14:41 NUG: wish they'd leave shit alone
14:42 Vimes: i thought it was an exchange thing
14:42 bigworm: when did you stop teaching formally mobius
14:43 NUG: well, then they should code a routine to change the exchange requirements to the old TOS symbols so our code still works
14:50 NUG: Thanks anyway
14:56 AlphaInvestor: Nug - use   /ES:XCME   in your if statement
15:01 rupam: the RTD function for "/vxx18" does not work - any ideas?
15:01 rupam: i.e. RTD("tos.rtd",,"LAST","/VXX18") returns an error
15:02 Up_n_Up: put it on a watchlist and export it and stop futzing with the Excel side
15:02 rupam: hmm
15:03 AlphaInvestor: use      "/VXX18:XCBF"
15:05 rupam: aha! thanks...
15:09 Up_n_Up: watchlist columns that get exported somehow magically have the correct syntax, it's .... increeeedable...
15:09 chief: Never mind grad students and quantum computers. This is the headline that should get more attention  "New research suggests that climate change could trigger a global shortage of beer. " 
15:15 Taurean: Hey could somebody help me with a study as to when the Stochasitc RSI on the 5 minute chart goes above overbought or oversold and the Average line and the Value line are both greater than or less than the previous on the 30 minute chart please
15:18 Mobius: cheif - That is serious
15:20 Mobius: big.. I retired full time teaching 20 years ago. I had a grad student course up until 2 yrs ago and a couple students finishing last year.
15:20 Taurean: Hey Mobius could you give me a hand with my above statement if you dont mind?
15:21 Mobius: Taurean.. For a scan that can be done with the scan wizard easily.
15:21 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - how the heck old are you, are you in your 200's yet?
15:21 Mobius: lol  close
15:21 AlphaInvestor: retired 20 years ago, dats a long time ago
15:22 Mobius: Some of us don't wait till we're 70 to retire you know
15:23 AlphaInvestor: I dream of retiring that early
15:25 MTS1: @180???
15:25 Mobius: Alpha... There's this little thing called trading. Try that and you'll never go to an office again.  :)
15:26 AlphaInvestor: never heard tell of that kinda thing ... how would one learn how to do that?
15:27 Up_n_Up: somebody told me it was hard once
15:28 Mobius: We've traded two inside days since the "Big Red One". How often does that happen and what typically happens next?
15:29 Up_n_Up: sounds like today's pop quiz
15:35 AlphaInvestor: I would bet that the 3rd day after Big Red is not an inside day
15:35 AlphaInvestor: BUT, if I knew the answer, I might just become a trader
15:37 Taurean: Im going to put this on the 5 minute chart...can someone tell me where i went wrong?
15:38 Taurean: StochRSI("rsi length" = 10, "k period" = 10, "slowing period" = 3, "average type" = "EXPONENTIAL")."FullK" crosses below StochRSI("rsi length" = 10, "k period" = 10, "slowing period" = 3, "average type" = "EXPONENTIAL")."OverSold"
MACDTwoLines(aggregationPeriod.THIRTY_MIN)."Value" is greater than MACDTwoLines(aggregationPeriod.THIRTY_MIN)."Value" from 1 bars ago and MACDTwoLines(aggregationPeriod.THIRTY_MIN)."Avg" is greater than MACDTwoLines(aggregationPeriod.THIRTY_MIN)."Avg" from 1 bars ago
15:39 New_Trade: Mobius plese, please open teaching trading room
15:42 AlphaInvestor: Taurean - split that into 2 or more separate conditions, then use
plot Scan = cond1 and cond2 and cond3'
15:42 New_Trade: 2 inside days and VIX = 21.30....
15:42 chief: There is a small pennant on the spy which is usually a continuation pattern. Break to the downside suggests 257 spy
15:43 Nube: I support Mobius having a teaching room but only open by invite to those with the sufficient foundation and desire as determined by the Selection Committee of One.
15:45 AlphaInvestor: Nube - do you chair the SCoO?
15:45 New_Trade: but  scripting is not mandatory...   LOL
15:45 novapawshere: I cant get an alert that occurs when one moving average crosses anohter moving average to work? can someone help me figure out why this may be?
15:45 amalia: 5/29,5/30&5/31 was last InsideBar
15:46 Up_n_Up: ok ,and then what happened?
15:46 amalia: The bottoming happened and we shot up.
15:47 amalia: 4.91% up before we formed a top
15:48 AlphaInvestor: Amalia - i'm game
15:48 Nube: M does.
15:48 novapawshere: anyone willing to hlep?
15:49 AlphaInvestor: Nova - Chart Alert, Marketwatch Alert, or Dynamic Watchlist Alert?
15:49 Nube: Don't get me wrong, I'm glad we don't have that - I'd have never learned to script.
15:49 novapawshere: marketwatch alert
15:49 AlphaInvestor: so for a single symbol
15:50 novapawshere: Like i do if this moving average of 5 periods crosses this moving average of 9 periods alert me. Activates but never alerts when they do cross
15:50 novapawshere: also i do alert if 'true'
15:51 New_Trade: amalia  on 5/29 - 5/31 /ES was above 50 MA and now we below 200 MA
15:52 novapawshere: I feel like it must have something to do with the chart timeframes because  moving averages are different if your looking at a 5m vs 15m but there is no way to select one within alert options as far as i can tell
15:52 slashgw: there should be the option
15:53 novapawshere: where?
15:53 slashgw: when creating the alert
15:53 novapawshere: how confident are you in that?
15:54 slashgw: https://screencast.com/t/R5h1wzt6
15:54 novapawshere: ahh
15:55 novapawshere: i just cant find it in the options though
15:55 novapawshere: wait
15:55 slashgw: https://screencast.com/t/QewgbCq9yeo8
15:55 novapawshere: the live support guy just found it for me
15:55 AlphaInvestor: So, do you have a Study Alert something lke this:
MovingAvgCrossover(length1 = 5, length2 = 9, "crossing type" = "below")
15:55 novapawshere: yeah
15:56 novapawshere: sweet i think that will fix it
15:56 slashgw: cool. goodluck
15:56 novapawshere: thankss slashgw and alphainvester
15:56 novapawshere: you guys rock
15:56 amalia: yw
15:57 AlphaInvestor: Another satisfied ThinkScript Lounge customer
16:21 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current.  Time to heat up a few ToS Scan Farm CPUs.
16:24 JohnnyQuotron: bks.. did your bubble issue get resolved?
16:26 FrankB3:  Would someone color the background of the chart:  when the pink line is over the blue>> green,  and when th blue line is over the  pink >> red,, thanks      http://tos.mx/Thr0JJ#
16:28 Nube: AssignBackgroundColor ()
16:29 FrankB3:   Do I have to first marry the two scripts to normalize them ??
16:33 Nube: If they aren't on the same script, yes.
16:37 FrankB3:   Really not a good idea,,, thanks any way....  Mr. Mo's  script close enough for ship yard work::      http://tos.mx/CeOe8E#
16:41 DSF_TX: Could someone help me with a script for a scan .  I want to scan for the 8 ema to be above the 34 ema for 21 days or more.
16:41 DSF_TX: I was able to write the script without the timeframe.  but want to add the 21 day timeframe.
16:42 AlphaInvestor: Combining a Momentum indicator .. and a Choppiness indicator, and looking for where they cross ... hmmm
16:42 AlphaInvestor: share what you have
16:43 FrankB3: Yep,, its called RSI Lagear
16:44 FrankB3:   already been done by Mr. Mo
16:45 AlphaInvestor: Frank - good point
16:45 AlphaInvestor: I don't know that the crossover is a signal tho
16:45 DSF_TX: http://tos.mx/bbxr7t#
16:46 Vimes: def ema8 = expAverage(close,8);
def ema34 = expAverage(close,34);
plot scan = sum(ema8>ema34,21)>=21;
16:47 AlphaInvestor: showoff
16:47 Vimes: me? never
16:47 Vimes: that has about a 50% chance of working
16:48 Nube: The swing from 0 to 1 or visa versa on the LG RSI is fast enough that often it will cross .5 and OB or OS on the same bar so it's likely not a bad cross to take as a signal.
16:48 Nube: Not because the cross itself is special, but the speed makes most crosses about the same
16:49 Donnie: Do they have a screener for the mobile app? Or just the pc
16:50 Vimes: Not sure on the screener part, but i know you can save a screen based watchlist and access it via mobile
16:51 AlphaInvestor: Nube - I configure mine to cross slower ... more of an oscillator, not a yes/no signal
16:51 Nube: Ah, then that would be a different beast
16:52 AlphaInvestor: I know that Mobius likes it to be more of a signal ... because he uses it for program trading
16:53 AlphaInvestor: I prefer the gray area ... when used as an oscillator
16:54 amalia: Donnie, the built in one are pretty good and accessible on mobile. If you prefer a custom one, create one on desktop, save it under a name then you can access the screener on mobile.
16:55 amalia: *ones
17:02 Nube: There's for sure a legitimate reason to want an indication to be an on / off switch. I make my final trade decisions based on a couple of yes or no criteria so it's clear cut. But screening before I get to the yes or no stage is entirely different matter, and one I do not want switch type indicators for.
17:06 TICKZ: Im trying to make a grid to look at the global markets..but I can't find the tickers.. Can Anyone help me plz? or any Ideas?
17:13 chief: tickz...just do a googl search on country etfs
17:14 TICKZ: ok. thanks
17:15 slashgw: also look at cme futures
17:15 TICKZ: like? /6a/6b/6e etc ?
17:15 Nube: Tickz, check out the ishares website. They have ETFs for most counties in the EAFE and the EEM
17:15 slashgw: sure, currencies as well as /NKD and I'm sure there are others
17:16 slashgw: checkout their website to see what all is available
17:16 Nube: ewt, Eden, qat etc etc
17:16 TICKZ: Ok. Thanks guys!
17:25 amalia: Just trade MinRange on /YM.
17:25 mthfr_vaxxed: amalia : did you prepare?
17:26 mthfr_vaxxed: i think your one of the few who listens to my crazy anticts
17:28 amalia: =)
17:30 hguru: How do you scan on the mobile app what am o missing ?
17:32 amalia: I listen to contributors. My leaning towards shortcuts in tS comes from BLT/Mobius, long term books are similar to AlphaInvestor, my daytrading is similar to Mobius’ ORB, my curiosity behind the veil in studies from Nube, etc.
17:33 Nube: Save a scan on desktop and it will be a watchlist on mobile
17:34 hguru: Hum ok I have a bunch of watch lists
17:35 hguru: Your talking scan results becomes a watchlist I get that
17:43 MTS1: Save it as a query and it becomes a 'live' scan / watchlist that updates in mobile.
17:43 MTS1: (Don't just save the output as a watchlist)
17:44 MTS1: Those dynamic watchlists / queries have a pink symbol in front of them on desktop.
17:46 MTS1: (OR green; believe those are option hacker scans)
17:58 hguru: Hum ok thx
18:03 inov: hello..i am writing a simple study alert like below and when I receive the Alert msg, I dont get the text "SimMovAvg_Greater", instead a portion of the code is shown, can one of you help
18:03 inov: def agg = AggregationPeriod.DAY;
plot cPrice = close(period = agg);
plot savg = close > simpleMovingAvg(cPrice,20);
Alert (savg, "SimMovAvg_Greater");
18:08 TICKZ: Nube.. im using your "LABLE" script to add the countrys name.. i change the studie name..but it keeps changing other lables... can you help me plz?
18:09 TICKZ:  
18:10 Up_n_Up: inov, if the syntax is right, contact support and tell them Alert is broken
18:10 TICKZ:  
18:11 Up_n_Up: I guess the obvious question is how did you change it?
18:12 amalia: Buy /YM
18:13 TICKZ: i changed the script name for each country.. thinking it will stp changing other countrys name..
18:14 Up_n_Up: the name of the script has nothing to do with what gets displayed
18:14 Up_n_Up: lounge rule #12 - you can't have your own syntax
18:14 TICKZ:  
18:15 Up_n_Up: that will ALWAYS display Saudi Arabia, no matter what the chart, but then you know that by now
18:15 TICKZ: hah yeah
18:17 Up_n_Up: the one means always display the text string
18:18 slashgw: should be able to take a vote on the syntax one
18:18 TICKZ: I gtg... Thanks
18:18 Up_n_Up: lol slash
18:22 DMonkey: tickz....you will need to use getsymbol() aand use an if then statement....
18:25 Up_n_Up: well not really right  addlbl(getsym()=="whatever", "whatevertxt");
18:26 Up_n_Up: so much fun to make up your own syntax....   :)
18:28 amalia: lol Wish it worked like that.
19:37 John1a: Is there a way to change the color of the columns in the price ladder DOM? I've screen shots with different colors for Bis Size column and other columns, but I cannot find a setting for it. Or is it no longer an option in the current version?
19:45 DMonkey: example....this is one way to accomplish.....you pick your symbols & what you want the text to display.....
addlabel(1,if getsymbol() == "SPY" then "SPY" else if getsymbol() == "XOM" then "Exxon Mobile" else "" + getsymbol());
19:48 admin_tculs: thinkScript Lounge chatroom will be closing soon   Please finish all conversations by 8pm ct   Have a nice evening
19:50 DMonkey: gn
14:30 bigworm: do you have your pairs trade during times like this mobius or do you switch to something else
14:30 Mobius: vs any day.  Trend is down and today added to that not take away
14:30 Vimes: well on my charts /es broke teh lower range of 10/24 and 10/25
14:31 Mobius: big.. I focus on intraday with markets like this. I short as many as 10 contracts a trade to protect my investments.
14:31 cajun: Vimes, just bodies count for inside days,,,, i think
14:31 bigworm: ok.. does your NN pickup times like this to not enter or exit pairs or is it manual?
14:32 Vimes: cajun, not for me
14:32 Mobius: manual - I literally clear all short term trades and turn it off.
14:32 cajun: oooo...different strokes
14:32 Vimes: price traded outside the range, right?
14:33 bigworm: ok thanks for taking time to answer a poor college kid
14:34 Mobius: keep learning and poor will take care of itself. Never trade because you have to. Trade when you should
14:35 bigworm: I have to pick a project for this term.  you had said you use PCA to select your beta and length for the gaussian smoother?
14:37 Mobius: if your looking for a project - a gaussian filter is a form of infinite impluse - consider building one with an error correction algorithm where length is the ec and beta is a fraction of that factor.
14:38 Vimes: woudn't PCA need a static time invariant data set i guess you could build a lagged data variable into the PCA data
14:39 Mobius: you can build the ec model with I(1) >< I(0) as the control
14:39 bigworm: im trying to absorb what you just wrote
14:40 Mobius: well you've got all weekend  :)
14:40 jason1419: Hi guys! Been reading and youtubing ThinkScript for two days now and I feel like this should be an easy script but I'm having trouble making it work. Can someone point me in the right direction? I want to put a callout bubble on my chart marking the close but only on specific days (Bubble 1 - three days ago, bubble 2 - seventeen days ago etc). I can add the bubbles, but it puts a million of them across the screen like a plot line instead of just the couple of days I want marked.
14:41 bigworm: ok so what youre saying is get some type of impulse response function that measures how big what youre trying to smoooth moves and take a fraction of that to filter out the smaller moves
14:41 Mobius: jason - the first variable in a bubble is the x axis and the second is the y.  If your x is open eneded you will plot all the way from it's start to the end of the data
14:43 Farmin: aka a low pass filter?
14:43 bigworm: yeah
14:44 Mobius: big - no that's what the gaussian filter does. However, the filter itself is an infinite impulse and so it's deterministic output is directly related to the length of data being used . Alter that using the beta and an error correction algorithm
14:45 bigworm: ahh ok
14:45 Mobius: In essence you will build a Neural Net
14:45 amalia: Yeah that’s what I was thinking too O_o
14:46 bigworm: i get what youre saying now youre saying to use it as an input
14:46 Mobius: A simple single Neuron single Node Net
14:46 Vimes: if that was to me, what i mean was in the process industry we could build a lagged vector to try and account for the autocorrealtion [x(t);x(t-1);...etc] pca and other methods can then give you insight to if these lagged dimensions are giving you any predictive power
14:46 bigworm: that does sound like a good project. Thanks for the idea!!!
14:47 bigworm: we just went over monte carlo methods and i thought it would be more complex
14:52 cajun: bigworm, when youre done, bring it back to share
14:52 bigworm: i have no problem with sharing... problem is sharing in thinkscript
14:53 Mobius: You've got to be pretty creative to get some of the needed functions to code in ThinkScript
14:53 bigworm: i actually dont do thinkscript.  I could learn, cant be harder than python or c++
14:53 bigworm: yeah right now all we do is kernels
14:54 FrankB3: Looks like Mr. Mo is right  about /ES heading up in close ... good deal will colse out all stock @107.70       http://tos.mx/jFL77x#
14:54 bigworm: that might be hard if you cant train in here
14:54 bigworm: wth looping and such
14:54 Farmin: well, sharing is only a problem if you make it one... there's MyTrade, UTC's OneNote, or his other thing, JQ's OneNote, etc...
14:54 bigworm: yeah from what little research I have done i post it up
14:55 bigworm: no problem sharing that in what I code in either.
14:56 bigworm: time is a factor as well.  im trying to graduate by spring so im doing full course load with more difficult stats courses so finding time to make code look good and usable isnt relly my priority when i am taking on projects at the moment
14:57 bigworm: I have coded up some good classifers in another language using kernels I could share
14:59 jason1419: Thanks Mobius. I must be calling the day wrong. Modifying the TS script from the formatting output chapter I tried this which I would think would limit my X per your instructions above, but I'm getting the same result.
def today = getDay();
AddChartBubble(today, close, "mark");
15:01 jason1419:  
15:01 Nube: Jason, try getday is equal to GetLastDay
15:02 jason1419: Tried that too. same result
15:02 jason1419: Was originally going to use get last day and offset it the number of days i wanted
15:03 Mobius: jason x must be a unique bar
15:04 Nube: Ah, those aren't daily bars.
15:05 jason1419: Right, having trouble figuring out how to define that.
15:06 Mobius: GetDay() != GetLastDay() is a unique bar
secondsFromTime(0930) is a single bar that happens each day
isNaN(close[3]) and !isNaN(close[4]) is a unique bar that moves with the current bar
15:08 bigworm: mobius do you think incorporating GARCH in a neural network is useful for forecasting or will a deep neural net perform just as well at forecasting volatility?
15:08 bigworm: without the garch
15:10 Mobius: TO GARCH or not to GARCH whether it is more noble to ARCH or ARMA is all in the eye of the beholder
15:10 bigworm: lol
15:11 bigworm: you make me laugh sometimes
15:11 bigworm: we should write a broadway show
15:12 Mobius: You have to decide based on use. There's no one right answer
15:12 jason1419: Thanks. Will chew on that for a bit.
15:13 Mobius: Your starting out from the same base - a regression analysis. In the end what model are you more comfortable with.
15:14 bigworm: I feel there is less complexity with the GARCH
15:14 bigworm: but i also am just being exposed to NN
15:15 bigworm: so by the end of the year I will have a better opinon.  
15:15 bigworm: I have to go do some kernelized ridge regression on MNIST now have a good day
15:16 Mobius: Read Plato's Cave. It applies to your perspective
15:16 bigworm: ok :)
15:16 Mobius: The one thing that is for sure is - change  :)
15:22 Mobius: Time for me to go GARCH up a JD and something to eat. Later folks
15:23 amalia: lol
15:23 amalia: Laters Mob.
15:32 MarkAlger: hi, I'm looking for FRAMA indicators in ToS.. is it supported or no?
15:33 MarkAlger: anyone home?
15:38 Farmin: supported?
15:38 Farmin: as in built-in?
15:44 MTS1: Not instant enough of a response Farmin;)
15:45 Farmin: guess he wasn't all that interested
15:46 cajun: you do all u can
15:47 Farmin: <<< not losing any sleep
15:52 FrankB3:   whats FRama ???
15:54 FrankB3:   Thanks Paris,,, did see your note
15:55 MTS1: probably some other MA combo
15:56 MTS1: ^Frank
15:56 FrankB3:   ok
15:57 MTS1: googl to the resque; it did sound familiar and surprised I did not find it in my TOS custom or built in; its Fractal Adaptive MA by John Ehlers. I'm sure TS supports it though to answer the question ;)
15:59 FrankB3: Hey, MTS, thanks.. learn something new here each day
15:59 MTS1: thank googl;0
