13:03 Vimes: step, your example works for me back to max available data, daily bars, the low gets plotted
13:03 Nube: I have never tried this but there is a first() function and I can't say whether that will carry the value to other bars so first(low) might be worth a try
13:04 stepandfetchit:    Note that the first 9 bars have the issue!  -- the yellow is just plotting the low
13:05 stepandfetchit: What am I doing wrong?  -- 
13:05 Nube: post the code, step
13:06 Vimes: here's my same example, and it seems to work:
 
13:06 Nube: May well be doing nothing wrong
13:06 stepandfetchit: Good point!  Let me do a clean build.  Likely something else is causing the greif!
13:08 AlphaInvestor: Step - who the heck cares what the low was 15 years ago, really?
13:09 stepandfetchit: Vimes:  Thanks!  -- I must have a bug.
13:09 AlphaInvestor: Or, asked a different way.   How will knowing what the low was 15 years ago make you more money tomorrow?
13:10 stepandfetchit: Alpha... This thnkscrpt is examining distance between new lows, so begins with most historice point, and advances to recient, so need it to START!
13:11 AlphaInvestor: so if it starts 15 years minus 9 days instead of a full 15 years ago your strategy is ruined?
13:12 Vimes: again i think for most studies there is a prefetch that is automatic, though not familiar 100%, if you really want to take care of initializing a variable use compoundvalue
13:12 AlphaInvestor: prefetch works on all Moving Averages
13:12 Vimes: oic
13:13 AlphaInvestor: since BollingerBands includes a moving average, it works too
13:14 AlphaInvestor: sometimes, if you include a moving average in you list of studies, it will do the prefetch for all the other studies too ... YMMV
13:14 AlphaInvestor: this is consistently inconsistent
13:15 MTS1: "Three thinkScriptï¿½ functions use prefetch: ExpAverage, EMA2, and WildersAverage." http://tlc.thinkorswim.com/center/howToTos/tutorials/Advanced/Chapter-12---Past-Offset-and-Prefetch.html; but I thought the SMA also. .
13:17 Nube: Average will, MTS. through a 200 day on a chart and it will plot from the first bar.
13:17 Nube: *Throw
13:17 MTS1: Yea; even the documentation that is there cannot always be relied on;)
13:17 AlphaInvestor: well, average is a moving average ... so
13:18 MTS1: Point is when I read doc before it specifically states EMA's and then lists the 3; I did not think it was all MA's which is why I looked it up again.
13:21 MTS1: Hm; maybe that's how the scanner looks back further; we found the other day the scanner not looking back as far as doc states, but maybe doc is considering prefetch also?
13:22 stepandfetchit: @ Alpha...  I just need to programatically determine when valid data can be referenced.  So, in this case, if  KNEW the first 9 bars were not avail, then I just start with next bar. So, if this IS related to "prefetch" amount, If I can compute the #bars of prefetct, I can use that to avoid the issue.  Is there a way to compute PREFETCH withing a thinkscript?
13:23 AlphaInvestor: Nube answered that use isNAN() to determine when you don't have valid data
13:24 AlphaInvestor: Does anybody else have a problem with either a) the Study  AccountNetLiq ... or b) the function   GetNetLiq()
13:25 AlphaInvestor: I have never had it return a net liq for me
13:25 stepandfetchit: Alpha... That does not work for the leading  (oldest) case!  -- 
13:26 stepandfetchit: I'll figure something out.
13:26 AlphaInvestor: what, you cannot use isnan() on the first 9 bars of the chart ... huh?
13:26 stepandfetchit: correct!
13:26 AlphaInvestor: that function should work on any bar on the chart
13:27 stepandfetchit: Agreed!
13:27 stepandfetchit: There is some "prefetch" issue I am bumping into
13:27 stepandfetchit: I will hack arround it, but was hopeing for a more elegent solution.
13:28 stepandfetchit: I may toy with that "compound" function (which I have not been using)
13:28 MTS1: steph, this has nothing to do with prefetch
13:29 AlphaInvestor: what exactly are you trying to do?
13:29 stepandfetchit: MTS1:  Can you enlighten me?  -- you are probalby correct,
13:29 MTS1: isnan works on any bar, but so should low. .
13:29 MTS1: Steph; look at the link I posted
13:30 AlphaInvestor: Step - if you are trying to do something like     close > low[9]     that is pulling data from 9 bars ago ... which won't work on the first 9 bars because that data won't exist
13:31 AlphaInvestor: compoundvalue cannot pull data from before the start of the chart either
13:32 stepandfetchit: Ah!  So, is NOT related to Prefetch (per your above ref).   Do you know what it May be related to?  -- is influenced by chart size (# bars trying to show), and influenced by any look-back references.
13:32 MTS1: but refering to prefetch close > Avg(low,1)[9] may work.
13:32 AlphaInvestor: what is the    IT    you refer to
13:32 MTS1: No steph; sounds like a data feed issue
13:33 MTS1: ignore my avg prefetch example; it only pre-fetches the number of bars data needed for the average.
13:37 AlphaInvestor: Tculs - do you or anybody working the Trade Desk today have any experience with either a) the Study  AccountNetLiq ... or b) the function   GetNetLiq()
13:39 stepandfetchit: Kinda interesting observation:  Attempt to plot "barnumber()", missing the leading bars as well!
13:40 MTS1: AI; I have nothign special in my accout and both seem to work for me. Have you tried emailing TS Support?
13:40 AlphaInvestor: all symbols, or just one symbol?
13:41 AlphaInvestor: MTS - I haven't, I was gunna call today to discuss ... but was asking Tculs if anybody with knowledge was in to discuss it with me
13:44 AlphaInvestor: MTS - I have a couple "special" things in my portfolio. One with a Q at then end of the symbol, one worth 0.0003 per share, a couple recent spinouts, and 10 leftover Washington Mutual Inc Escrow thingies
13:44 MTS1: I've not tried often, but seems eml is easier for TS specific issue; not timely respose but probably gets to the right person to answer. Seems like TradeDesk has to transfer / refer to TS team which when I've called after hours they said only in during the weekdays.
13:45 MTS1: But I've not been around long and go here for most my TS support needs;)
13:46 MTS1: Oh; no symbol; just just blank function w/o inputs and dropped the study on a chart; happened to be $TICKAR chart;)
13:46 stepandfetchit: If interested:  This seems to find the "mysterious" leading "unreferenceable BARS": def secret = first(barnumber());
13:50 AlphaInvestor: MTS - what is the TS Support e-mail?
13:50 MTS1: Steph; guess not sure what the issue with IT is; or why your script would not work because of it. Pretend the first bars are not there and the chart starts after that? It sounds weird, but is what it is I guess. Can pass it to support and see what they find; but probably need to give them ticker and chart timeframe.
13:52 MTS1: AI; thinkscript@thinkorswim.com is what I've used.
13:53 Burns56: Hi I am looking for some help on how to combine 3 lower studies into one complete study, I can easily do it on my computer but i am trying to combine to see if they will load on my ipad , any help would be greatly appreciated                                                                  ## TD Ameritrade IP Company, Inc.

13:54 MTS1: Burns; did you see what that looked like before you hit enter?
13:55 stepandfetchit: MTS1:  I think I can code arround this now, using that First(barnum.. kludge!  
13:55 Vimes: still not sure its an issue if you had a more reasonable chart horizon i doubt you would see the issue
13:56 Vimes: and even on my chart with 15 years it works fine
13:56 Burns56: http://tos.mx/swR1qD#
13:56 Vimes: Burns, has redacted his own study
13:58 stepandfetchit: Vimes:  Some of my scripts requrie some lookback/lookforward, so looking for a generic solution for them as well. --  This seems to be at least a partial solution for me.
14:01 JohnnyQs_BackupWks: the LoungeArchive is current.  It even contains Burns56's invisible study
14:01 AlphaInvestor: Thanks MTS - emailing them now
14:02 Burns56: I apologize its like i am using disappearing typing, Help
14:02 MTS1: Burns; I won't open a workspace I don't need unless maybe I'm in PM; maybe try sharing the chart or the script? As for posting script directly in here; try to run it through something like notepad so that there is no extra formatting like from e-mail or word etc added.
14:02 Vimes: step, i get that but i guess what i'm saying is even if you have let's say a 6M, 1D chart with a 9 period lookback TOS will still look past your current chart setting, you typically do not need to do anything special:  This is plottting close[9] for example.
14:03 MTS1: Burns; please exit and re-enter the room to fix your font.
14:05 MTS1: Vimes; not what I've seen; is that the far left of your chart? Maybe they changed somethign. .
14:05 Vimes: that is the left of my chart,yes
14:05 Vimes: no other lower studies or upper studies

14:08 MTS1: That is strange Vimes; I think that may be new. Just tried it on shorter SPY chart and see the same as you, with max available is the only time it starts after the lookback index period. .
14:08 Burns56: Iâm sorry if it didnât come out correctly I donât have a lot of experience with posting here. But itâs three separate lower studies that Iâm trying to combine into one so hopefully I can load on my phone when Iâm traveling
14:09 MTS1: Burns; on your PC exit the room and re-enter that will fix it.
14:10 MTS1: Then see if you have a better formatted script that you can paste from notepad
14:11 stepandfetchit: If anyone is interested in an example for what I observer on certain Symbols when time frame is very very large, here is simple script:
14:11 stepandfetchit: 
plot apriorclose=close[5];
def secret = first(barnumber());
plot sc=secret;
addlabel(1,secret);
#
14:12 AlphaInvestor: WOW!!! that script from Burns is even worse now that I can see it
14:12 stepandfetchit: Use VXX or UVXY with 15 years to observe, then switch to spy or something
14:12 MTS1: Burns; Also at first glance it looks like you should just be able to append the scripts together into one; just take out the extra 'declare lowers'. The issue may be scaling; in which case the studies have to be normalized. May be easier to just overlay the 3 scripts in which case TOS does the normalization automagically.
14:12 amalia: lol
14:12 MTS1: Using white background now AI?
14:12 MTS1: ;)
14:12 MTS1: Oh the re-post. .
14:14 MTS1: First one actually looked better;)
14:16 Burns56:  
14:16 hbmicro: AI, Burnout again???
14:16 Burns56: sorry is that to big?
14:16 Burns56: 75% reduced
14:18 MTS1: Burns; what are those 3 different indicators at the bottom?
14:18 amalia: Try 10
14:18 Burns56: "WOW!!! that script from Burns is even worse now that I can see it" Omg i needed a belly laugh thanks / now you know you are dealing with a genius. sorry i will exit stage left
14:20 Burns56: RSI, This indicator that this gentlemean hahn shared and i modified a little and another called traders tips divergence that i dont know how or when i got it
14:20 MTS1: So RSI goes between 0 and 100; the other ones?
14:21 Burns56: i can post them one at a time or probably better to not torture you guys with my insanity
14:22 Burns56: the rsi is standard
14:22 amalia: One at a time is good

14:29 Burns56: This is the third studythey all work fine when I combined them separately on my computer into one lower chart individually
14:30 Burns56: I would like to be able to write them into one study combined without having three separate lower studies because I havenât figured out how to combine three separate studies on my iPad manually
14:30 Vimes: the advantage of having them separate is when you drag them together TOS will autofit them to the lower panel, why do you want them in one study again?
14:30 Vimes: ^
14:30 Vimes: oh
14:31 Burns56: Yeah when Iâm traveling Iâd like to be able to get out of the SPY using this chart I guess I could bring my laptop
14:31 MTS1: Burns; the first study does not work; it has a function Li in there that does not exist; you probably have a typo.
14:32 Vimes: out of curiousity what are you trading that you want to see divergence with CL and correlation with SPX?
14:32 Burns56: Sorry the first studyis just a standard RSI that comes loaded in thinkorswim I mustâve copied and paste it it incorrectly
14:32 Vimes: Li should be absvalue()
14:34 Burns56: Yeah itâs funny that itâs giving a pretty good signal for me when to get out of the market when one of the cyan line crosses below to exit in both cyan lines cross above the pink line to enterWhat do you can correlate it up just about against anything on the platform It gives you that potential
14:36 Burns56: Of course this was last yearâs market conditions who knows now
14:38 Burns56: If anyone could improve on it that would be great .Iâm just like a kindergartner working with it
14:39 MTS1: Well; this is what it looks like on one chart; not sure if normalizing would do much for you either:  
14:43 amalia: Well, glad that got settled. Next!
14:44 Nube: Burns, which condition for each of those indicators do you look for when deciding to exit?
14:46 amalia: Burns left.
14:50 AlphaInvestor: Sometimes peeps on phones and pads don't show up in the list of People in Room
14:50 amalia: Pictures or it didnât happen
14:54 Nube: Maybe he's having Smithers monitor the chat for him.
14:55 AlphaInvestor: Nube - berged for TV prefereces ... I had to look that up
14:55 Burns56: Sorry I have something on the stove brb
14:56 Vimes: you never watched the simpsons alpha, cmon, man!
14:56 AlphaInvestor: I can say that I have never suffered thru a whole episode
14:56 MTS1: wow. .
14:57 Nube: Put together a silly Correlation Index and then got to thinking maybe o should take it serious. Anyone know what some of the most common factors are that quants tend to use? With there being an ETF for everything now we could probably see when those correlations get egg shaped
14:58 AlphaInvestor: Nube - I know the factors in common use
14:58 AlphaInvestor: most of the underlying data needed is not available in thinkScript
14:59 amalia: ^
15:00 amalia: >=|
15:00 MTS1: TCULS; could you please delete my picture? 
15:02 amalia: Why
15:03 Nube: Drats, Alpha. I was hoping to have it be simple.
15:04 Nube: If there isn't a price to sales etf, or price to ebit etc then we have ourselves a niche to fill.
15:05 twoshoes: TDA should start a "Fantasy ETF" league.
15:06 Vimes: nube, you may already know this but look up the crsp indexes, all (i believe) are available on TOS,
15:06 Vimes: http://www.crsp.com/indexes-pages/crsp-indexes-quick-reference-guide
15:06 Burns56: MTS thank you
15:07 amalia: yw
15:08 Nube: I didn't know that, Vimes. Thanks. That will help out a lot.
15:09 Vimes: it doesn't capture yet some of the volatility facotr investments but has the majority of the common investment styles tracked
15:09 AlphaInvestor: TwoShoes - one recently shut down, that I cannot name here
15:10 AlphaInvestor: Thanks Vimes - news to me too
15:15 Vimes: again, likely obvious but you would just use the index identifier for the symbol in tos, the totral return indexes can be helpful if you want to simulate returns with dividends, (however they don't have volume) so you wouldn't be able to get to carried away: CRSPTMT, for example
15:18 AlphaInvestor: For the week, the winning sectors were Utilities (+1.0%), and Consumer Staples (-4.0%) if you can call a -4% a winner. The losers were Materials (-9%), and Technology and Industrials (tied at -7.0%). This is using SPDR data pulled using TOS and RTD.
15:19 Vimes: that's definitely bearish, xlu, xlp leading
15:23 amalia: I started trading after Obama came into office. What is.... bearish?
15:24 AlphaInvestor: yung pup
15:25 AlphaInvestor: dats when minRange quits workin'
15:25 amalia: lmao
15:26 Nube: Emerging markets outperforming is not bearish.
15:26 Nube: So all is not lost yet
15:31 Nube: I'm not saying buy Brazilian Small Caps, mind you.
15:32 AlphaInvestor: Two of my "market posture" indicators went bearish on Thursday, the sector rotation model actually went bearish on 09/21
15:38 Nube: That was timely.
15:42 AlphaInvestor: belay that -- Big Hand went bearish on the daily chart, but should have been run on weekly. Still bulish now.
15:48 Nube: Pretty much every I have looks ill on the daily but weekly doesn't look worse than a normal market spill yet. There's always next week.
15:50 Nube: Limit down Sunday night is my hope.
15:50 AlphaInvestor: So I have 3 Market Posture indicators Bull, 2 Market Posture indicators Bear
15:57 Noob1: So it just occurred to me that Netflix reports on Tuesday. If mkt in the toilet could they even sail w/ gd er?
15:57 Noob1: Good earnings
16:04 MTS1: Or maybe good earnings will lift the market. . Not sure; my crystal ball indicator has a bug in it;)
16:05 MTS1: If you don't have an edge; don't play it
16:06 AlphaInvestor: since they are spheres, crystal balls don't have edges - just sayin'
16:07 MTS1: THAT's the problem with the indicator I guess; keeps going in loops!
16:08 amalia: lol
16:10 bsinks: This is pretty awesome.........didnt even know there was live chat rooms.
16:11 AlphaInvestor: Bsinks and Noob1 -- this chat room is for thinkScript coding discussions only. There are other live chat rooms open Monday to Friday if the market is open
16:12 MTS1: this one is pretty awsome though!
16:14 bsinks: Can I ask if there is a thinkscript for a custom column on the scanner for a time stamp so I can sort by time that a new stock hits the scanner.
16:15 AlphaInvestor: You can ask, that is a perfect question for this forum
16:15 AlphaInvestor: Unfortunately, there is not
16:15 bsinks: lol........story of my life.......thank you
16:17 MTS1: But if you save it as a query = dynamic watchlist, you can set it up to e-mail alerts to you when stcks get added (or removed); which you could sort in your e-mail reader.
16:18 AlphaInvestor: They will also show up in the order triggered in the Message Center
16:18 bsinks: yea thats how I watch it is in the message center......but it adds like 8 at a time
16:19 bsinks: still it works pretty good like that
16:19 Vimes: or even send you a mobile alert which is what i use
16:22 MTS1: Vimes; have you used other types also? Wonder about timing; seems like mobile alerts for order confirmations are sometimes very timely and sometimes delayed. Wonder if there can be a delay in any of the communicatoin methods and how MW alerts handles them.
16:23 Vimes: well i guess i should clarify that i'm using the trader app on mobile, it seems to alert at the exact same time as my pc platform
16:24 Vimes: even on pc  i think there is a dealy of a few minutes for watchlist alerts
16:25 MTS1: OK; have not tested / compared the different methods yet, but wonder if there's a difference between methods.
16:26 AlphaInvestor: Look at the LAST price for JPM ... does TOS know something that I haven't heard yet?
16:28 Vimes: maybe i'm not looking right, i see 106.95
16:30 AlphaInvestor: I got 0 on the Analyze Tab
16:30 AlphaInvestor: and a watchlist
16:31 AlphaInvestor: RTD pulls 106.95 -- curious
16:35 Nube: Push Alerts on the mobile app have been good in the little I have used them. Text and email are so so
16:44 JohnnyQs_BackupWks: The LoungeArchive is current.
16:45 amalia: Thanks
16:50 Paris: In case anyone is interested, I tracked down the second script that Burns56 posted. Seems that this was modified from a script that Nube posted on 7.13.2016 called BB Divergence with Mobius Standard Deviation Line.
16:53 AlphaInvestor: oh, that was back when Nube was but a noob
16:55 amalia: Thanks
16:56 amalia: Thanks
16:58 amalia: wtf
17:00 AlphaInvestor: amalia is very thankful today '-)
17:04 amalia: Dude somethings up w mobile app. Itâs a recurrence
17:04 Nube: You're welcome
17:04 Burns56: Paris thank you do you have the original ? thanks
17:07 Paris: Here is the attribution of the 3 scripts that Burns56 posted earlier today.

Script 1: Standard TOS RSI study
Script 2: Modified from Nube's study called BB Divergence with Mobius Standard Deviation Line posted on 7.13.2006
Script 3: Relative Strength Scan from Hahn Tech
Note that Hahn's script is also available on Youtube
17:07 Burns56: yes thats where i got that one
17:08 Paris: Time for breakfast. BBL.
17:09 Nube: I forgot about that script. The idea was for the next step to change the bands to something more conventional but never followed through
17:10 AlphaInvestor: I have trouble reading those scripts that are all jumbled together because of the small text on my screen. However, It seems to me that it would be a happy accident that a study with /CL in it would be a good Combined Signal Approach candidate for all equities or indicies. The other two make sense, but are they really just the same thing in different clothing?
17:11 Burns56: it also looked good with $TICK and various $pcall symbols
17:12 Burns56: i checked it with some strong monthly sectors like health care and services too
17:14 Burns56: i thought it may have some potential with the vix too but i am just looking at different ideas
17:14 amalia: Thatâs what drew Nubeâs attention away from it; looking at different ideas.
17:15 Paris: Burns56 - I'm on mobile, and to respond to your question, yes I do have Nube's original study of 2016, which is where I found the correspondence. Will be back in about an hour's time.
17:22 AlphaInvestor: got to go now - Later Traders
17:22 AlphaInvestor: Tculs - thanks for opening the room for us again today. You da bomb!
17:31 Vimes: i learned that if you hit the reformat code button, it will quickly fix the code that was pasted, just fyi
17:32 Farmin: majil
17:32 Farmin: majik
17:32 Farmin: now if they would just have a fix errors button
17:33 Vimes: thtat woudl be sweet, find replace would also be sort of convenient
17:34 Farmin: hmmm, like a grown up editor?
17:34 Vimes: exactly
17:44 Burns56: TZA symbol with $tick as secondary symbol looks interesting on that chart
17:51 Burns56:  
18:14 amalia: Uncheck Fit Studies
18:16 Bear: Hey
18:16 Bear: Does anyone know how to simulate buying trades?
18:20 amalia: OnDemand on paperMoney
18:25 G3_: Til Sunday eve open.  Good night tculs and all.
19:02 Farmin: bear, you have to hang around longer than that
19:21 amalia: Laters g3

05:44 slashgw: gm all
05:49 DMonkey: ð
05:52 slashgw: hey DMonkey, gm.  here is the beginning of what I have been working on, based on that chartbubble code. https://screencast.com/t/54lIo4cNtAO
06:02 DMonkey: looks good
06:08 slashgw: thanks!  still working on the automation portion via Python.  able to pull the data easily enough from online, just working on formatting the output to the thinkscript file.
06:29 TICKZ: @slashgw who made that bband studie?
06:32 slashgw: tickz, that was made by a friend of mine
06:33 TICKZ: whats his name? i hve the same studie..but i dont know who made it..
06:33 slashgw: won't say his name, but initials are jb
06:33 TICKZ: ok
07:43 PhatDog: i've been trying for sometime now to come up with script to identify stocks that have less than 5 trades during the after hours/pre hours session.  anyone have such scrip?
07:44 MTS1: Phat; you could only potentially do this on a tick chart set to 1 tick, and count the bars after RTH. Look at the date/time functions for functions available to check when RTH ends.
07:47 Vimes: I don't think you can use ticks in the scanner though
07:51 PhatDog: i'd be good to count the 1 minute bars during that session.
07:52 Vimes: Phat, instead you could scan for a particular volume in pre-market
07:53 MTS1: Phat; assuming since you're looking for low volume and may not have multiple trades on the same 1 min bar that might work for you. What is the purpose of finding such stocks?
07:54 PhatDog: possibly, but ive been unable to come up with the scipt to capture a total volume during the session
07:55 Vimes: You're the first one i've heard want to look at low volume in pre-market as an indicator, but i know there have been several pre-market volume scans shared here -let me see if i have one saved
07:57 PhatDog: its one factor to identify low volume pre market stocks the move upward during the regular session
07:57 Vimes: Try this on a 1min agg in teh scanner with extended hours checked, you would need to adjust the volume threshold:
def Active = SecondsFromTime(0400) >= 0 and
                     SecondsTillTime(0930) > 0;
def vol = if Active and !Active[1]
                then volume
                else if Active
                        then vol[1] + volume
                        else vol[1];
plot isTrue = vol >= 500000;
07:59 Vimes: Phat, ok but that is going to be almost 100% of all stocks behavior (imo)
08:08 PhatDog: Vimes, tried your code with no other factors and just changed your vol to 5000 and no matches.
08:10 Vimes: works for me there are about 385 stocks >5000 and 8317!!! less than 5000 again low volume or low trade count is not going to find a needle in teh haystack so to speak
08:16 PhatDog: ah yes. so sorry. had another limiter still on.  THX!
08:16 Vimes: yw
08:27 MTS1: Logic seems contrarian to what most traders would be looking for volume wise.
------- Friday, October 12, 2018 -------
15:23 VolCrush: so bronx, don't u owe us something?
15:23 RandomDan: I think the market is set to go sideways, newsflow dependent.
15:24 blondetrader: lol
15:24 blondetrader: we didnt open 2780 so I only owe it to u
15:25 AlphaInvestor: So, WFC which missed E is up 1.3% today ... but JPM that beat E is down 1.09% today. What kinda bizarro world do we live in.
15:26 VolCrush: ok, i'll wait patiently for the "ping" on my phone
any second now, right?
15:26 blondetrader: keep watching for it
15:26 JC_chart: cuirious on rty trade
15:26 RandomDan: It's my fault Al. Fins going up as soon as I take a loss on my GS.
15:26 JC_chart: mind sharing your entry and exit and chart timeframe
15:26 RandomDan: but I don't feel like doing that
15:26 VolCrush: welp you Alpha, more than anyone here know that funnies don't mean chit with respect to how the market reacts
ergo, drop funnies
LOL
15:27 JC_chart: totally ok if you say no... just interested
15:27 VolCrush: i figured bronx, never keep your word....typical w
15:27 blondetrader: lol
15:27 blondetrader: well its not like i wear a tutu to trade
15:28 VolCrush: but u trade nekked , no?
15:28 blondetrader: JC I am flat rn
15:28 blondetrader: this was not the day I expected
15:28 blondetrader: haha no
15:28 JC_chart: did you hold it thru last night?
15:28 blondetrader: I did
15:28 blondetrader: and got stopped out this am
15:28 JC_chart: holy s**
15:28 JC_chart: that's a big stop LOL
15:29 blondetrader: no lol I made $$
15:29 RandomDan: bt, really. This is exactly the day I expected... using your TA!
15:29 JC_chart: i am sure you did
15:29 JC_chart: u were short right
15:29 AlphaInvestor: Vol - with both reporting the same day, they should have reacted in relation to their E results
15:29 blondetrader: :)
15:29 JC_chart: as of yesterday afternoon
15:29 blondetrader: no i was long into this am
15:29 VolCrush: welp send me a pic wearing red soled only then...........
15:29 JC_chart: ohhh i thought you were short
15:29 VolCrush: Alpha, they did
15:29 JC_chart: it went up 25 points
15:29 blondetrader: nooo I was on for the rally pffft
15:29 blondetrader: I was looking for 95 lol
15:30 RandomDan: she was long, I remember
15:30 JC_chart: what tiemframe do you use to identify entries
15:30 blondetrader: 4 hr mostly
15:30 blondetrader: and dly
15:30 RandomDan: so what about the day didn't go as you expected?
15:30 blondetrader: well Dan I thought the pop would have more teeth
15:30 blondetrader: this was like a little kitten
15:30 blondetrader: not a lion
15:31 RandomDan: I thought it was pretty good, considering the wreckage.
15:31 blondetrader: I would not be surprised to see another wave of selling monday am b4 we get any consecutive days of green
15:31 blondetrader: dissapointing
15:32 blondetrader: but i have some scary tgts lower
15:32 RandomDan: the day was a big cup, also a positive.
15:32 blondetrader: so to avoid mkt need to do some work
15:32 VolCrush: not a bad pop actually, only because the close was vary gud on /nq
so respectfully disagree
15:32 blondetrader: nq could rally another 100
15:32 blondetrader: and still look like shit
15:32 VolCrush: or more
15:33 blondetrader: btw that would be res for leg 2
15:33 blondetrader: anything over........we good
15:33 VolCrush: well we wanna buy chit, who wants to buy gud?
15:33 blondetrader: lol yes but if nq fails that
15:33 blondetrader: you can buy it a lot cheaper
15:33 VolCrush: sell against
15:34 blondetrader: like to the tune of67s
15:34 VolCrush: true but we got pick our lines in der sand
15:34 blondetrader: figure 150 off this weeks low would be next tgt dn
15:34 blondetrader: well nq needs to hold 7112
15:34 VolCrush: i gots my names for hunting season and will fall on my sword if necessary
15:34 JC_chart: we could have some violent upswing no doubt in the indexes but I think insitutions need market to drop more so they can buy it and bid it back up like they do in every cycle
15:35 blondetrader: yes
15:35 AlphaInvestor: I think this past couple days was selling der MoMo and a rotation into Quality. MSFT, ADBE and such did very well for me when those trades were put in this week during the downturn
15:35 blondetrader: as i mentioned we have a htf bear move happening that isnt complete momo wise
15:35 blondetrader: and we have a dly oversold
15:35 VolCrush: heck i wanted 6845 on /nq, when i called 7 k /nq i got laffed out of here 
15:35 blondetrader: so would make sense to get some relif
15:35 JC_chart: yeah 6800 is the midpoint for nq for a 1Y daily chart
15:36 VolCrush: ah hah, ty @JC
15:36 JC_chart: honestly all that matters is AMZN
15:37 JC_chart: so we should just trade that as it makes up what percent of NQ ... 60 haha
15:37 VolCrush: emmmm, der fruit is a playa and mr softie is now relevant for some reason
15:37 blondetrader: 1835 needs to break amzn
15:37 blondetrader: orr 1621 lol
15:38 blondetrader: rty closed red today
15:38 blondetrader: no bueno
15:38 VolCrush: either way lots of resistance with every pop now
15:38 JC_chart: RTY is very sick on my chart
15:38 VolCrush: yah true dat, rty is a big problem atm
15:39 blondetrader: honesly
15:39 VolCrush: yes dear
15:39 blondetrader: if it has to rinse like to get it done this month
15:39 JC_chart: it trendline has been down since 9/24 and the pitch of that line is steep not much releif soon unless earning are rocking
15:39 blondetrader: like before last week of oct
15:39 VolCrush: welp u wanna see a down trend line go see XLF
15:40 blondetrader: it made a lower low today lol
15:40 JC_chart: youre right it is sicker
15:40 blondetrader: and it leads imo
15:40 blondetrader: this turned 1-2 weeks b4 the others gave it up
15:41 JC_chart: so any of you ever traded wheat futures or soybeans?
15:41 blondetrader: yep
15:42 JC_chart: you know they have nive moves in the morning
15:42 blondetrader: I do :)
15:42 Bid_Ask: what's nive
15:42 JC_chart: and they are super volatile but i was thinking i almost like them better than es
15:42 blondetrader: for sun night mon am i am really leaning on selling rty
15:42 JC_chart: you have the same payout
15:42 blondetrader: they offer minis
15:43 blondetrader: imo the trend is more true in ags
15:43 JC_chart: i was sitting in soybeans yesterday and forgot about the monthlyr eport and it ripped about 5 dollars in a nano second
15:43 blondetrader: yea got to mind those report
15:44 JC_chart: i was lucky i was long it also whipped back so i did fine but yes that was my thought exactly when i  sold the contracts LOL
15:44 blondetrader: lol
15:45 JC_chart: when you speak of trend you are speaking of trend on daily right?
15:45 blondetrader: genericly yes
15:45 blondetrader: but I prefer when all time frames are in agreement
15:46 JC_chart: me too ibut i try to just focus on one chart
15:46 JC_chart: i look at the daily 30m for trend
15:46 JC_chart: and then trade the 3 or 1m
15:46 blondetrader: oh yea thats too small for me
15:46 JC_chart: i built some indicaotrs that are multitimeframe so that helps just using one chart
15:46 fred__w: jc  i use 3 charts for context  1yr-mo 3mo-wk 14da-da
15:47 fred__w: and look for >11ema
15:47 JC_chart: im happy with a 10 tick move on cl or gc moer is great but i am greatful for that
15:47 JC_chart: im not an ema fan
15:47 fred__w: jc  i do that to build probability
15:48 JC_chart: but i get why you use it so please dont misunderstand my intent
15:48 fred__w: jc  the particular method is not criotical  i was giving you a variation of bt's stmt
15:49 blondetrader: :)
15:49 blondetrader: I have errands......see you guys sund night
15:49 JC_chart: appreciat that
15:49 JC_chart: have a good weekend

06:18 Bealzybub: Yo-Ga
06:43 Tom: When I was on Prophet Charts last Thursday, Oct.11 the days CHARTS showed up well.  On Fri. Oct.12 (as has been the case 1-2 times per month) the chart for Thurs. was simply not there.  This has become an all too frequent occurance in 2017 &2018. Now, for the first time, the last 2 trading days are NOT showine up on Prophet Charts.  Many times I have contacted Technical Support.  I have asked them if it is "my computer or your" responsibility and have been told they "are aware of the problem."  Now, for the first time, the last 2 trading days are NOT showine up on Prophet Charts.  What is every one else out there doing about this problem?  I suspect this problem started to occur when TD Ameritrade took over.  In my communication with support personel I have been told there are other 'changes' coming.  Good Grief...Does anyone in the community have a solution...other than going to ScottTrade?
06:50 Bealzybub: Wish I could help. I cant even get answers about the "Marketwatch" trade trending lines.
06:51 Bealzybub: Which is really no problem. I'll get it figured out one way or the other. I'm making my 4% per day.
06:51 Tom: Do you have the same problem on Prophet Charts?
06:52 Bealzybub: I dont even know what that is. Which is the same answer I get when asking about "Marketwatch".
06:53 Bealzybub: I mean I've just been asking the community here and havent bothered tech @ Ameritrade.
07:00 Tom: TDAmer took over ThinkOrSwim, which as their trading platform, has the wonderful old Investools platform (if I have the history correct), but the Tech Support people have not been able to solve this problem.  They admit it is their issue and not my computer.  When the went over to Ameritrade we lost many of the research abilities and one, in particular, indicator...Virtual Volume (VV%).  All of the placating and "education support" they've offered have been ineffective in helping together with direct conversation.  I've moved funds and not placed funds with them because of their lack of genuine support.  This is the first time I've gone public and have asked for anyone with solutions to the problem and any similar experience(s).  
07:02 Tom: Is anyone else out there using the ThinkOrSwim, Prophet Charts platform for trading, research, etc?
07:06 Tom: It is still early in the morning to get suffiecient responses, but as I've turned on the ThinkOrSwim website & platform, I've noticed that the past 2 trading days (last Thurs. & Friday) charts are simply not there, even though I used them on their given days!
07:39 nora: Hi Tom.   TDam had announced last year that they were not going to support/upgrade Prophet charts any more.  In fact it was supposed to go away.  I have used and still am trying to use Prophet charts but recognze its limitation.  I am surprised that it is still functioning and available.  The Tos charts have lots of problems amd limitations also.
07:40 nora: My prophet charts have thurs and Friday.
07:40 MTS1: Tom; TDA 'took over' Thinkorswim ages ago, as well as prophet charts and more recently invest tools. ScottTrade was the most recent addition that they took over, but did not intergrate their platform. Prophetcharts has been slated for retirement for a while also, when supposedly all features are moved to TOS, but still left in for legacy users complaining when it was removed. I would not continue relying on prophet as a primary platform considering the priorities within TDA / TOS, and see if the TOS side is a better fit.
07:41 Nube: Prophet charts are no longer supported with any particular concern so I wouldn't expect to continue to work with them
07:41 MTS1: So you're too late to move to ScottTr;)
07:44 nora: The TOS charting had a really tough time last Wed and Thurs because of the high volume.  The charts froze for different lengths of time and lagged fro others.   
07:44 dellsystem: Whats going on with WTW  no Last 
07:50 nora: i have a premarket last... for WTW, 66.88 fwiw
07:51 dellsystem: Yes the  Feed is not updating  Think or Swim
08:01 dellsystem: Just updated
08:01 dellsystem: and now retracted
08:02 Tom: Where are the rest of you with your charts & research?  Where are the great trading platforms today?
08:03 AlphaInvestor: #TOSisBoss
08:04 Tom: Sorry Alpha...but read my paragraphs, above.  I used to think the same as you!
08:05 AlphaInvestor: Prophet is being sunsetted, suck it up and use TOS charts
08:05 AlphaInvestor: I can no longer get parts for my Edsel either
08:06 Tom: My complaints are about TOS...I HAVE TOS, and Prophet charts are what is displayed!
08:06 radon224: Alpha, I can give you a link for Edsel parts if you need it
08:06 AlphaInvestor: Prophet Charts = bye bye
08:06 Tom: How do I make the switch you describe?
08:07 Tom: I've been with InvestTools, TOS since 2007 but have received no notices for any type of switch that I can recall.
08:08 AlphaInvestor: There are two charting systems right now in thinkorswim a) TOS charts, b) Prophet Charts. Learn to use A, because B is going away
08:10 tmoney20g: will do big daddy Al
08:10 gerardom: sup tmoney
08:10 tmoney20g: o hi gerar
08:10 AlphaInvestor: As MTS1 mentioned, we were told that all Prophet functionality would be moved to TOS charts before it finally goes away
08:10 gerardom: gm man
08:10 tmoney20g: missed you on friday
08:10 tmoney20g: got my trailstop for options working
08:11 tmoney20g: just have to get used to it
08:11 tmoney20g: don't know why i didn't enable that 6 months ago
08:11 gerardom: nice! im going to test once out today
08:12 saint: where do i find level  2
08:12 gerardom: did u get into any positions from friday?
08:12 AlphaInvestor: Tmoney - as I mentioned last week, if you are using Stops with options... Then you don't understand options!!!
08:12 Tom: Alright...show me how to get to TOS charts. TOS is now what I use...but the chart display is still called/labeled "Prophet."  How do I enable it?  Tech Support has NOT suggested that in any of my communications with them.
08:13 Tom: When you converted were there any deletions of your current information, at the time?
08:13 tmoney20g: went 4/4 on friday
08:13 AlphaInvestor: TOS charts are to the left of Prophet Charts on the menu
08:14 Tom: I'll start there, Alpha.
08:15 radon224: RIP SHLD....no surprise
08:15 tmoney20g: never even heard of "prophet" charts
08:20 AlphaInvestor: Don't get me wrong, I love Prophet Charts
08:21 Nube: Tom, click the charts tab. Those aren't he ToS charts. Click the Prophet tab and you get the Prophet charts.
08:21 Vimes: I should maybe give them a second look, just confusing that they have two charting engines on the same platform
08:22 AlphaInvestor: That's why one is going away
08:22 tmoney20g: if they are going away, why even bother
08:22 tmoney20g: looking like buyers at the open ?
08:23 Nube: Prophet had the advantage of being able to do ratio charts in the ticket box and it had a better pattern finder but those are the only two advantages I ever found it to have. Had more historic data which could be meaningful depending on the user but ToS has mucho historic data now too
08:23 tmoney20g: what's your take on the econ data Al ?
08:24 AlphaInvestor: Pattern Finder in Prophet is da bee's knees
08:26 Scott_OT: Only 1 out of three computers I have TOS on shows a prophet tab.
08:27 tmoney20g: 2 minutes
08:27 AlphaInvestor: Tmoney - must have sold lotsa cars to get the combination of numbers released this morning
08:28 esmal: good morning all
08:28 tmoney20g: i was interested in the internet retail
08:28 tmoney20g: up 1.1% i think they said
08:28 tmoney20g: but amazon gapped down a little at 830
08:29 tmoney20g: what you eyeing esmal ?
08:29 Nube: My take on econ data is that we should outlaw collecting it so there charlatans of monetary experiment can't use it as an excuse to monkey around
08:29 AlphaInvestor: Internet retailing... It's just a fad
08:52 HoBo: /
08:58 Vimes: Weekend update, I was digging into the Mobius volatility compression study (SqueezePivots), that was discussed in the chat last friday. I wanted to make it easier to review prior squeeze events on a historical chart, so I added some of the legacy points to the chart from the default study.  In addition, I was thinking it would be helpful to visualize the compressed trading range prior to the squeeze entry.  I used half this range to estimate a proposed risk value, which might be used against signals while "in the squeeze" range or upon squeeze exit... Finally, i thought it might be interesting to take the whole range while in the squeeze event to form the basis of a pivot projection to give a visual for potential risk off points or to better interpret the trading action after the squeeze exits, this is kept active until the next squeeze fires.  See the attached for a quick visual and the modified study.  I've placed all my code at the very bottom of the default study. Hopefully, this is additive to the original study, if anybody has any improvements or better coding skills to make it more useful/practical please feel free to modify.  Or if its complete garbage, well that's ok with me too.

09:32 JohnnyQuotron: Vimes.. what software are you using to add the text and your Name with Underline?    
09:33 Vimes: snagit
09:33 JohnnyQuotron: Good Morning Scripters...
09:33 Vimes: there is a free version i belive as well
09:34 JohnnyQuotron: vimes... thank you.
09:35 JohnnyQuotron: windows 10 not has a built it but it doesnt annotate
09:37 Vimes: you can also annotate withiin tos but a bit tedious
09:39 JohnnyQuotron: agreed. TY
09:50 nextrade: Vimes-nice-thanks for sharing !
09:50 Vimes: yw
09:52 nextrade: gives nice visual for mobius' ppo osc
10:16 nextrade: i overlay a second ppo osc- set at 20 /50 change histograms  to lines - and wait for cross at extremes
10:16 EAK: hi all.  i would like an alert on parabolicSAR and it's not available.  Can anyone here help me with this? 
10:18 Vimes: Eak, if you are willing to try, read this:

10:21 MTS1: EAK; if you're talking about MarketWatch alerts PSAR uses recursive variables which are not allowed in MW Alerts. Chart alert function is the one Vimes mentioned which can easilly be added.
10:21 AlphaInvestor: Squeeze Bars ... now that is the kind of bar I can get my head around
10:23 Vimes: thanks mobius, will take a look later
10:23 Vimes: is there any merit to how i'm thinking about your oringal study?
10:23 Mobius: EAK - Since ParabolicSAR will scan you can setup MarketWatch alerts, email and SMS notices that way.
10:24 katherine1234: annyone know how to find EOY 2017 balance for IRA?
10:24 Mobius: Vimes - I've not been able to prove ANY statistical advantage or value to a squeeze. I keep looking though.  
10:26 Vimes: ok- i guess i'm confused then, why code the orignial squeeze study - do you not believe volatiliy compression is a valid heads up to trading?
10:27 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - it makes logical sense that Options IV should reduce while in the squeeze, then expand when the squeeze exits. Have you looke into that? If so, that would be tradable - buy options in the squeeze to sell them after it exits.
10:27 Mobius: lol   I've coded well over 10,000 studies. I find little of value in most of them.  I code because I can
10:29 EAK: Thank you Vimes and Mobius.  
10:29 EAK: and MTS1
10:30 Vimes: ok, visually to me this has some merit, maybe should try and simluate some backtest results
10:30 Mobius: Alpha.. If price squeezes and then drops IV will rise. But if price squeezes and then rises out of the squeeze IV will reduce. Without knowing which way price will breakout of the squeeze what can you sell or buy while price is in a squeeze that gives you any advantage??
10:31 Vimes: I guess it also gels with everything i've read back to dow theory, etc on periods of consolidatino, distibtuion, etc. to find the next period o f volatility expansion, so i'm not trying to challeng you more than clarify how you think about things
10:32 New_Trade: Hello smart scripters       Do you have a script to show small labels Advance and Decline value in left corner of my charts?  Would like to see it for futures /ES /NQ /GC ...and also for stocks   Thanks
10:32 AlphaInvestor: if price squeezes IV should drop, I agree that exiting the squeeze to the downside will cause a big IV rise. But exiting the squeeze to the upside could cause a minor uptick in IV ... since ATR and such went up.
10:32 Mobius: Alpha ... Prove that  :)
10:32 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - I was asking if YOU had tested that
10:33 EAK: so guys, i looked over that page, and it's foreign to me.  TD apparently won't code anything anymore.  They too told me this would be easy.  Is there ANY chance of someone coding that ParSAR alert PLEASE?
10:33 AlphaInvestor: I know logic and markets don't always go hand in hand  '-)
10:33 Mobius: I've tried and failed to find that very notion
10:35 Vimes: EAK, what alert on you exactly wanting and what did you not undrestand about the syntax of the alert functino
10:35 mthfr_vaxxed: you try looking during live markets or you use historical option chain stats to find it?
10:36 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - thanks, then I won't waste computer cycles, electrons, and precious brain cells on the search
10:36 EAK: vimes, just a simple alert to trigger when this indicator switches it's signal
10:37 DCR: Does ToS have the ability to tell what kind of options transaction took place on any given options trade.  Ie a Sweep, Tied to Stock, Spread, etc?
10:37 EAK: I don't understand much about coding.  I've tried my hand at it on and off since the intro of the PC.  I don't seem to have an aptitude for it.  
10:38 Vimes: DCR, only thing i know is the trade flash gadget
10:38 DCR: @Vimes, Thank you
10:39 Mobius: Alpha.. You may find what I couldn't.  What I found was that while in a squeeze if typical duration IV didn't do much at all. If a squeeze lasted a long time IV wold drop but not often far enough to profit from a strangle or straddle 
10:39 Mobius: Since you don't know which way price will breakout those seemed the only logical trade options to me
10:41 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - agreed in principal. But the location of prior support/resistance would enter into my decisions if doing manual trades
10:43 Mobius: Ok - What would be a scenario we could test?
10:45 Vimes: Well a squeeze to me means historical volatility is collapsing, which you are betting on a future volatily expansion?  Whether this is predictive of IV is perhaps another beast
10:47 harndog: Warning...always dangerous.... ariff on Mobius' trend line of squeeze...substitute ECI  and re-run. https://www.screencast.com/t/gW3UIkv4LfB
10:47 harndog: a riff
10:48 harndog: Note: In this script, I track the start of the Fractal Balance Point, and I call it (FBP).
10:48 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - sounds like you already tested it.
But - IV pre-squeeze - IV In the Squeeze - IV post-Squeeze - a) when squeeze exits up, b) when squeeze exits down. Sort these by Squeeze Lenght ... look for tradable patterns.
likely beyond the capability of TOS
10:49 harndog: Here is the script idea shown in the visual: http://tos.mx/EXcR0h#
10:51 harndog: I am heading out, unfortunately, but visually, tracking the FBP starts did a nice job tracking the market and how a trader should not fight a  "V" trend reversal.
10:53 Vimes:  
maybe similar view of same time frame?

10:54 New_Trade: Thank you Paris
10:55 Paris: yw
10:57 harndog: Vimes... Substituting the ECI and Mobius' flag version, "might" do a better job highlighting the expansion contraction market nature. Also, the Flag script has the ECI label measuring compression.
10:57 harndog: Again... all filtered through a padwan learner...:)

11:01 gary8329: In a watchlist,  is there a way to show the Week and Month opens?
11:08 EAK: Glad you guys are feeling the love.  Any way I can coax that knowledge to code my "simple alert" for ParSAR?  Thanks :)
11:11 Nube: There isn't anything to code, EAK. Just set up a scan for it and set an alert. viola.
11:11 MTS1: Gary; please clarify
11:11 MTS1: (Open whats?)
11:11 EAK: I will try that NUBE.  thx
11:18 gary8329: Week Open woud be at what price the stock opened at on the first day of the week.   Converserly, Month Open would be the opening price of the stock at the first day of the month. 
11:18 Double07trader: Hi all, anyone know if there is some setting to allow one to drag order prices on TOS chart, i can drag on demo account but not on live account (e.g. i want to move up a Stop Loss using mouse) ?
11:19 MTS1: Gary; just select open to be displayed and make sure you use the aggregations mentioned for each column
11:21 Vimes: gary, you would need to create two separete custom quotes one set for wekly aggreationg with something like
plot o = open;
and then do the exacty sme thing for the weekly
11:21 Vimes: er monthly
11:22 gary8329: I see.  Create a custom quote.

12:34 bkstrader: I need some help from a bubble expert. I have read the JohnnyQ
Educational material and tried a few tests but I can't get current
Variable values to show up in a bubble 8 bars away from current 
Bar. Any help would be greatly appreciated here is the code
input barsFromNow = 8;
def na = Double.NaN;
def bn = BarNumber();
def currentBar = HighestAll(if !IsNaN(close) then bn else na);
def currentDay = HighestAll(if   bn == currentBar then day else na); 
def hi = HighestAll(if bn == currentBar then high else na);
def lo = HighestAll(if bn == currentBar then low else na);
AddChartBubble(bn == CurrentBar + barsFromNow, lo, +KeyEvent + " Evt \n" 
+Round(ADX(),0) +" ADX\n" +Volume() +" Vol \n", Color.Light_Gray, 0);
All values are showing as N/A
12:41 MTS1: Is "day" defined?
12:41 Nube: !IsNaN(close[8]) and IsNaN(close[7])
12:42 Nube: bj, the values are showing na because there are no values in the expansion area.
12:42 MTS1: nor is keyevent defined?
12:44 MTS1: Start troubleshooting the location of hte bubble by just using "test" for the text; then add in the text syntax once the locatoin is correct? Text syntax can be tested with a label also.
12:44 Nube: Yeah, not sure what's up there. Either way he will have to make whatever value recursive and then Bob's his uncle
12:45 bkstrader: Nube I understand that . I tried to use (0)  and [bn] to define current value. That;'s the part I don't know how to do . Key event is a variable I defined. The bubble will show on the current bar but I don't know how to define it in the expansion area
12:45 bkstrader: MTS  The bubble shows where it is supposed to but the variable values show as n/A
12:46 MTS1: Then the bubble locatoin is not the issue? Seems like you're saying it is corect but not in the expansion area which is contradictory. Can't troubleshoot the variable values without the rest of the script if the only issue is the text displayed.
12:49 Nube: keyevent[8]
12:49 bkstrader: I tested the values in that snippet with a bubble on the current bar and they show up fine. I can't figure out how to reference the currnt value in the expansion area is that possible ?
12:49 TICKZ: bkstrader is that a adx studie?
12:50 Nube: Make keyevent recursive or index it back at least as many bars as you have moved the bubble forward.
12:50 bkstrader: Tickz I have the TOS Code for ADX in a larger script
12:51 TICKZ: just asking..i have a couple i picked up here..
12:51 TICKZ: was wondering if you need..
12:52 bkstrader: Nube I tried ADX [-8] and that didn't work  not sure what I need to do differently
12:52 TICKZ: http://tos.mx/vlwmX1# adx
12:52 TICKZ: http://tos.mx/jjW8aT# adx
12:52 TICKZ: http://tos.mx/6LkSkx# adx
12:53 bkstrader: Tick Thanks but ADX is not the problem its referenceing current bar in the expansion area
12:53 TICKZ: oh ok
12:54 TICKZ: http://tos.mx/3MrTfG# psar
12:55 JohnnyQuotron: bks... when you scripted the fool proof x axis addchart bubble did it paint in the proper place?
12:56 Nube: bk, that's 8 in the wrong direction.
12:56 Nube: That's 8 forward from where you have the bubble, you want 8 back.
12:58 bkstrader: JohnnyQ The scipt from the library works fine fine . I modified it with new lines and my variables theat's when I get the N/A
12:59 bkstrader: Nube If the bububble is 8 bars in expansion isn't current ADX [-8] from the bubble ?
13:00 JohnnyQuotron: minus sign is future.  Trust Nube.. Nube knows math
13:00 JohnnyQuotron: bks.if the bubble is in the future you need to access the value from the past
13:01 bkstrader: Tried ADX [8] still n/a
13:02 Nube: bk, how hard would it be to delete the minus sign and try it.
13:03 bkstrader: Just did Nube no luck
13:03 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current.
13:05 JohnnyQuotron: Question.. has anyone scripted a scan for the Gaussian Self Adjusting RSI Laguerre with FE?  I will try if not.
13:09 JohnnyQuotron: bks.  trouble shoot.. try a bubble with just the adx...  then try another with just the other variable data one by one  create debug labels for each bit of variable data you want in the bubble.  
13:09 Nube: bk, did you use the incorrect syntax that is in the post at :03?
13:09 JohnnyQuotron: Is the bubble in the proper xy location?
13:10 anees: hello , is there a way to get the floor pivot points, i get the pre programmed pivots and they arent accurate thanks
