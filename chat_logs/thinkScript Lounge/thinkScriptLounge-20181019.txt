09:49 ruffle: Trying to find newly IPO&aposd stocks
09:49 ruffle: Or IPO within x number of days
09:50 MTS1: Ruffle; that's quite  different than your earlier example; what does that statement mean in plain english? 
09:50 MTS1: In any casep if there is no bar 100 days ago there is no close; but that's different than NaN
09:51 MTS1: NaN means there is a 'bar 'but no value for close; like the expansion area. If you want items with less than 100 bars simply use BarNumber() function
09:52 ruffle: Is appendix d wrong? OHLC values of the current symbol are NaN when a script tries to retrieve them from the time point before IPO or before the first visible bar on tick and range charts. The same happens when the script tries to retrieve OHLC values from the right expansion of the chart (i.e., from the time point in the "future", which doesn&apost have any OHLC values yet).
09:52 Mobius: Arianna - It's impossible for you to offend me. My statement stands regardless of your past use.  Zscore is a simple indicator of where price is in a standard deviation envelope. The levels are simple reminders of excepted standards. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 standard deviations from the mean.  If you knew what you were looking at you'd have known that
09:53 MTS1: Nope; example from D rowks fine
09:53 Ariana3: Mobius: I know that, I asked how to write in the code.
09:54 ruffle: Seems like you&aposre telling me "OHLC values of the current symbol are NaN when a script tries to retrieve them from the time point before IPO or before the first visible bar on tick and range charts" is not true?
09:54 ruffle: Is not true?
09:54 Mobius: I gave you the code.  The only thing you need to do is add

plot one = 1;
plot two = 2;
plot three = 3;
09:55 MTS1: Debug it Ruffle and check it out; I also gave you a solution I know works.
09:55 Ariana3: Mobius: Thank you very much!
09:57 Mobius: Just as a reminder -
We don't work for TOS. We're traders interested in helping other traders to learn to code. We appreciate those that try to learn. Those that just want a code because they don't know how to code are encouraged to learn to code. Anyone can that works at it a bit.
09:59 ruffle: Ok I&aposll try that. Still puzzling to me why the other way doesn&apost work. Seems like exactly what app d is stating!
09:59 Mobius: ruffle - keep at it - the light will shine just before the train hits you
10:00 ruffle: Thanks guys & thanks Möbius I was starting to think you might work for ToS! Ya&aposll are really awesome for helping us!
10:09 inov: hello Mobius...thanks for ur reply but I would like to know the highest intraday volume, let's say around 1:00 p.m or any time before end of RTH.....any tips on how to code will be helpful
10:21 Vimes: inov, what you are requesting will predominatly be the open or close as mobius said, it could be coded as you requested, but maybe as an alternative look at this "high volume node" code from Mobius:
# High Volume Nodes
# Mobius
# V01.02.2018
# Looks for the highest volume candle in "n" periods and plots the candle range. 
# As Volatility increases this study has two values. Plotting a current high volume node as a channel which price will be drawn back to and test since a very high volume node will move price quickly, and price will retest that area. And, with the legacy plots a way to quickly see if larger traders, those that can generate a high volume node, are accumulating or distributing inventory. 
input n = 20;
input LegacyPoints = yes;
def h = high;
def l = low;
def c = close;
def v = volume;
def x = barNumber();
def HighVolume = if ((v - Lowest(v, n)) / (Highest(v, n) - Lowest(v, n))) >= 1
                 then x
                 else Double.NaN;
def hh = if !IsNaN(HighVolume)
         then h
         else hh[1];
def ll = if !IsNaN(HighVolume)
         then l
         else ll[1];
plot hhLine = if x >= HighestAll(HighVolume)
              then HighestAll(if IsNaN(c)
                              then hh
                              else Double.NaN)
              else Double.NaN;
hhLine.SetDefaultColor(Color.GRAY);
plot llLine = if x >= HighestAll(HighVolume)
                              then ll
llLine.SetDefaultColor(Color.GRAY);
plot legacy = if LegacyPoints and !IsNaN(HighVolume)
              then l - (2*TickSize())
legacy.SetStyle(Curve.POINTS);
legacy.SetLineWeight(3);
legacy.SetDefaultColor(Color.Gray);
AddCloud(llLine, hhLine, Color.GRAY, Color.GRAY);
# End Code High Volume Nodes
10:21 nextrade: that gave me  an interesting idea to propose to TDA. I would think that the small fortune that TDA has spent to attract the 11 million funded accounts - was to increase their profits-not to teach all of us how  to code ; which is in itself a lengthy and to some a fruitless endeavor.I would think most of the 11 million clients just want to place trades ( which is revenue for TDA ) - not to be coders. So- '' Hey TDA - how about hiring a smart coder to help clients design the scripts that they wish to use in trading ''. If it increases their trading activity ( and you make more fees); then you keep the coder in house. If TDA does not see an increase in trading activity- you fire his a_ _.
10:23 Vimes: i think they could do more, but they at least try to stay connected with some developments like TASC and provide those indicators in platform each month
10:23 AlphaInvestor: Next - they have some peeps who do that for High Net Worth and Active Traders -- I know, becuase I know some of those people, not because I am one
10:24 Up_n_Up: how the other half lives
10:26 nextrade: guess i'll have to sell the Farm - to increase my account size -)
10:26 inov: thanks Vimes
10:28 Vimes: np, Mobius is primary to thank as i find alot of use in that indicator
10:30 nextrade: Ai- 20 years ago i was with a broker, and my account rep was a former salesclerk. He non-chalantly told me that he liked working for a broker, because he got to see the big money accounts- and their monetflow
10:32 Mobius: As in much of life - It's not what you know but who you know that often makes the difference.
10:34 AlphaInvestor: I know Mobius ... it has made a huge difference
10:35 AlphaInvestor: Thank you kind sir!
10:35 inov: Thanks Mobius for your help
10:35 Mobius: ha - You need to get out more often  :)
10:36 Nube: Having someone else write my scripts for me does not appeal to me one bit. The wisdom of that has to be inversely proportional to account size.
10:38 AlphaInvestor: Nube - I am more than happy to have you and Mobius write scripts for me!
10:43 Nube: Better be sure, my scripts have me long Turkey and Brazilian Small Caps
10:44 Nube: The good part of that is that if those trades work then ES is going to 5k so we'll all be riding high
10:46 AlphaInvestor: Nube - I think the elections in Brazil will turn those markets, to some extent already have
10:51 Nube: I'm a firm believer in the bullish politics is gridlock
10:51 Nube: So could well be
10:56 Mobius: Seems Brazil is always about something short. Brazillian Bikini, Brazillian Wax ......... Maybe Short is just a better idea
10:57 Nube: I ain't bullish on this thing their century, so maybe I should hedge...
10:59 online1: @Alpha or others - is it possible to have this scan show results for the net change starting from the 9:30 open?  I have no idea how to do modify.
http://tos.mx/6jbtdI#
couldn't sshot as was too bid and then couldn't see if made smaller
11:23 Nube: Watching what we do here like a hawk.
11:36 New_Trade: I just would like to follow Mobius trades...So many scripts only confusing but following big money...would be great   Better learning experience 
11:36 MTS1: Online; looks like you shared a wachlist, not a scan query or the script. Look at Mobius' ORB script for example of checking if the time has passed (Active) so you can retain the open so you can use it to compare with current close to calc net change.
11:37 MTS1: Agreed NT; good attitude. Not just see the trades though; understand trade decisions.
11:38 New_Trade: Yes I need to learn a lot
11:40 New_Trade: So would be great to ask Mobius to have teaching and trading room  He learned from his dad....
11:41 MTS1: He already spends as much time here as he likes;)
11:41 New_Trade: Agree he is helping a lot
11:41 MTS1: He's retired you know; in the right way it sounds like: Doing what he enjoys;)
11:44 New_Trade: It is very hard to learn by myself.    Zillions scripts not really helping.   I would like to find a better way to learn to make money
11:46 AlphaInvestor: In the long run you need no more than a dozen indicators, mosly likely about 6 or so, carefully selected
11:50 New_Trade: And how to use them right way
11:50 AlphaInvestor: Xactly
11:52 MTS1: scripts are just tools to help you see what's happening with price. key is finding what works for you; usually that means lots of chart reading / testing. Then have a trading plan based on what you know statistically works and follow that plan. Record your trading decisions and review those in hindsight to hopefully improve going forward (how you followed / did not follow your plan and how to improve plan / execution). Indicators are probably only a very small part of what it takes to make money...
11:52 woodie: oooops sorry wrong place

12:45 Vimes: different platform
12:50 online1: MTSI - it is basically this -
 
12:50 online1: but the change is from the close of yesterday and I would like the net change to be from the 9:30 opening
12:51 amalia: What's the formula for net change?
13:05 DMonkey: net change from open....
def o = if secondsFromTime(0930) == 0 
        then open
        else o[1];
plot change = c - o;
13:07 donh: Mobius, Ever since TOS changed the futures to a two digit suffix rather the one,  the SpotRisk study that you created does not seem to work at all.  Can you suggest a fix?  Looking at your code, I only see that the problem may be associated to the GetSymbol()=="/NQ".  Appreciate any suggestion?
13:08 amalia: The mobile friendly version:
declare lower;
def o = if GetTime() crosses RegularTradingStart(GetYYYYMMDD())
then Open
else o[1];
plot change = c- o;
13:09 MTS1: Don; confirm the current value for /NQ in your charting window and update the script with the new value TOS is using now
13:10 MTS1: believe /NQ:XCME for NQ
13:11 donh: MTSI - Thanks I'll try your suggestion.
13:14 amalia: donh, please exit and re-enter the room. Thanks.
13:16 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current.
13:17 donh: MTSI - Thanks again.   Your suggestion worked.
13:18 MTS1: yw
13:20 donh: The room seems choppy and slow even after following Amalia's request t exit and reenter the room.  Logging out for now.  
13:21 MTS1: room seems fine; the logging back in was to fix your font. Sorry (not) if we're too slow to respond;)
13:22 amalia: ^
13:55 HighDesertZero: I need to read up on referencing one study within another what topic heading would that come under?
13:56 AlphaInvestor: High - you can Reference built-in studies, but not custom user studies
13:57 HighDesertZero: grrrrrrrr, thanks alpha
14:01 amalia: You can use Script{}
14:46 em11: http://tos.mx/ldV5mA#    hi all, can some one direct me on where to find info on how to code the highest and the lowest of the colored interval ... two EMA crossing, highest and lowest of the candles located when fast EMA below slow EMA
14:56 thomas7156: Trying  to create a custom scan code to select stocks which are above the MA midpoint and the Upper_Band of a Keltner Channel. With the MA as a variable zero point the selection channel would fall in a range of about +1.25 and +2.5 times the MA. Here id the thinkscript

15:01 Vimes: really like maybe something with the word "trade" or "trader" in it
15:02 AlphaInvestor: or Worthless, or GoingToZero
15:03 Mobius: Totally Dude
15:03 thomas7156: Mobius gave me the following yesterday  and perhaps I changed something wrong. Any help would be greatly appreciated
15:03 Vimes: do penny stocks even have options, whats teh point
15:04 em11: thank you Mobius, always appreciated
15:05 Mobius: yw
15:06 Mobius: Vimes - This is no place for logic..  Oh wait, maybe it is.  Good point!
15:07 Vimes: if only i could afford 100 shares of this penny stock, oh wait let me buy the options!!
15:10 Mobius: thomas.. the syntax for referencing a study in the scanner is
StudyName()."PlotName"
if your going to change any input in the study that change with the input name has to be added between the parentheses
Example:
StudyName(length = 30)."PlotName"
15:39 Biometrizilla: Have a question about indexing. If I create a new study with def x = x[1]; plot showx = x; then x is always zero. Then if I change to def x=x[1]+1; and plot, x starts at 2 and increases by one for each bar. I thought that defining x sets it to zero so x[1]+1 should start at 1. I have used the x=x[1]+1; in a couple of custom studies and have x[1]+1 starting at 2 for one study, x[1]+1 starting at 13 for another. Does ThinkScript do some sort of auto-lookback period determination that determines the value of x[1] for each study?
15:41 Mobius: If you want to index x then use compoundValue
compoundValue(1, x[1] + 1, 1)
where the first variable is the bar to start the second is the variable to perform and the third variable is the initial value
15:45 Biometrizilla: Does that mean that the code on the Web site for Inertia is incorrect?
15:45 Biometrizilla: script inertiaTS {
    input y = close;
    input n = 20;
    def x = x[1] + 1;
    def a = (n * Sum(x * y, n) - Sum(x, n) * Sum(y, n) ) / ( n * Sum(Sqr(x), n) - Sqr(Sum(x, n)));
    def b = (Sum(Sqr(x), n) * Sum(y, n) - Sum(x, n) * Sum(x * y, n) ) / ( n * Sum(Sqr(x), n) - Sqr(Sum(x, n)));
    plot InertiaTS = a * x + b;
}
input length = 20;
plot LinReg1 = Inertia(close, length);
plot LinReg2 = InertiaTS(close, length);
15:45 Mobius: no  it means your use was.  That code works as designed
15:45 AlphaInvestor: Biom - don't Dis der Mobius scripts
15:46 Mobius: I have checked every study and function in TOS - There is only one that doesn't work as purposed   declare once_per_bar
15:48 Biometrizilla: Not dissing, trying to understand. I know that the study works. How is the usage different? I took the code I just posted and put it in a new study. If I plot x it starts at 13 on the first bar. Why does it do that?
15:49 Mobius: My crystal ball is broken. You'll have to post the entire code for me to give a reason
15:50 Mobius: Or you can use AddLabel or plot .Values_Below to deBug your code
15:51 Mobius: There's always a reason. And; 99.99999% of the time it's PEBCAK error
15:52 Mobius: That holds for me too. Not picking on anyone
15:52 thomas7156: Thanks Mobius  I need to do some reading and study on thinkscript coding syntax etc.. I haven't done any coding in the last 30 years and that was basic and early C+. I chanded the top 2 line to input try to get dome feed back from TOS and I posted the chqnged code I changed the inputs back to def and the scan runs bu does not finish or display anything. Further study for sure won't hurt me. I have been retired for 4 years and I have some time to devote to it.  Thanks so much for your help I really apreciate it. I use your and really like your True Momentum Oscillator that someone sent me. Thanks Again I'' be back
15:54 Mobius: thomas  - For some scans it's easier write the scan as a STUDY frist to make sure it's plotting as you want then reference that plot. I find that easiest
16:00 Biometrizilla: Code coming up. I took the inertiaTS off the website, declared it a lower study and put in a plot statement in the script. In this case the x value for the first bar seems to match the length value.
16:00 Biometrizilla: declare lower;
script inertiaTS {
    plot xplot = x;
16:00 Biometrizilla: It has to be operator error but I need to figure out what I'm doing to cause it.
16:04 amalia: Refer to post @hh:50
16:04 Biometrizilla: Then if I take the same code, don't use the script approach and use different equations for calculating slope and intercept, the output matches and this time x for first bar is 13.
16:04 Biometrizilla: declare lower;
input length = 89;
# Incrementing x for each bar moves endpoint each bar
# This duplicates the TOS LinearRegCurve function, which calls Inertia
def x = x[1]+1;
plot XPlot = x;
# Slope & Intercept calculations
def Ex = Sum(x,length);
def Ey = Sum(price,length);
def Exy = Sum(x*price,length);
def Ex2 = Sum(x*x,length);
def Denominator = (length*Ex2) - sqr(Ex);
def Slope = ((length*Exy) - (Ex*Ey)) / Denominator;
def Intercept = ((Ex2*Ey) - (Ex*Exy))/ Denominator;
plot LinearRegCurve = (Slope * x) + Intercept;
LinearRegCurve.setdefaultColor(color.Red);
# Check against TOS built-in Inertia function
plot InertiaTS = Inertia(price,length);
InertiaTS.setdefaultColor(color.Yellow);
16:08 Up_n_Up: don't know if this applies in this case, but in any case you probably should find 'prefetch
16:08 Up_n_Up: in the manual/tutorials and understand the potential impacts
16:10 Up_n_Up: CompoundValue, as was pointed out,, is a more definitive of initializing a variable,
16:10 Up_n_Up: *method* of
16:11 AlphaInvestor: Yeah ... where does it get that first X -  I am sure Biom is assuming the first X is zero ... but why is he assuming that?
16:12 AlphaInvestor: def X = if barnumber() == 1 then 1 else x[1] + 1;      # might work better
16:12 MTS1: Debug the code as suggested already to find out. .
16:13 Biometrizilla: Up_n_Up - that's what I was refering to in my initial question. Prefetch determines an auto-lookback period based on what is going on in the study. I'll investigate this some more. Thanks for pointing me in that direction.
16:14 Biometrizilla: AlphaInvestor - I believe in reading through the material that when discussing recursion it was stated that when you define a variable it starts at zero. But that may not be the case if Prefetching comes into play.
16:14 Mobius: Prefetch isn't used except for infinite impulse ThinkScript Native Studies.
16:14 MTS1: Nope; based on the MA period and type only Bio
16:15 Mobius: You can not call or access prefetch
16:15 Mobius: from thinkScript or any thinkScript function. Only the native studies call it
16:15 MTS1: That's why compoundvalue was suggested.
16:16 Biometrizilla: Past offset is what looks like is the appropriate item. It's on the same page as Prefetch.
16:16 Mobius: native studies and native functions such as
ExpAverage()
Average()
WildersAverage()
16:17 MTS1: Past Offset does not impact 'visible data' which is only data TS has access to.
16:17 Mobius: Although Average isn't an infinite impulse tos does use prefetch so that it plots at the first bar
16:17 bigworm: native blankets
16:18 Mobius: Alrighty then. Time to find something interesting to drink.
16:18 bigworm: jack and coke?
16:18 bigworm: that used to get me into trouble
16:19 Biometrizilla: So I posted the cut and paste from the Inertia definition. Would you expect that x at the first bar would be zero?
16:19 Mobius: I'd never ruin a perfectly good whisky with coke. Yuk
16:19 bigworm: are you saying jack daniels is a good whiskey?
16:20 Mobius: Bio.. I expect nothing I check.  Use SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.Values_Below) and find out
16:20 bigworm: ive been told makers mark is pretty good.  also, they have a cool bottle.
16:21 Mobius: JD is whisky.  Single Barrel is Good and some others are great
16:21 AlphaInvestor: Biom - I would expect it to be some random number pulled out of the air ... because you didn't initialize it
16:22 AlphaInvestor: It MAY work sometimes, but in every case it is Bad Form
16:26 Biometrizilla: Ok. I'll play around with CompoundValue. Plenty of examples in the online information that shows def x = x[1] + 1; as a valid way to do things.
16:27 Mobius: Bio..
def x = x[1] + 1;
def y = compoundValue(1, y[1] + 1, 0);
plot data1 = x;
data1.SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.Values_Below);
plot data2 = y;
data2.SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.Values_Above);
16:33 MTS1: And Bio; remember that we here have no input or control on the manual; just volunteers interested in TS that try to help. The manual is certainly a place to start learn TS or find functions, but when you get answers here and suggestions (and how to) debug to verify what's happening, it is of no value to argue, repeat code examples without debugging, or quote the manual back. .
16:36 AlphaInvestor: Biom - add this as well. You will see that my method, which initializes the first bar using a RECursive variable, also works
def z = if barnumber() == 1 then 0 else z[1]+1;
plot data3 = z;
data3.SetPaintingStrategy(PaintingStrategy.Values_Below);
16:36 MTS1: (quote the manual back questioning the answers without verifying yourself I meant)
16:43 Mobius: Valid for a use. Like a hammer is valid for a use. But painting a house isn't one of those uses. Sure you could do it but it'd be a lot easier to use a different tool
16:45 Mobius: In Incrementing a variable it may or may not be important to start at 1 or 0.
16:47 Nube: As an example, when I was a lad I washed my mother's car with a rock. A rock is a perfectly good tool, not so much for cleaning mumsie's Cordoba however.
16:48 Nube: "I love what you've done to my Cordoba" was not her response
16:48 Mobius: ha
16:49 Mobius: I did the same sort of thing when Brillo Pads first came out
16:49 AlphaInvestor: Mobius - how did the boat fare after Michael?
16:50 Mobius: No problems. Alpha...  Not anything the bilge pump even had a hard time with  :)
16:52 bigworm: sometimes I acutally laugh out loud at whats said in this room
16:53 bigworm: not just a fake lol but furealz
16:53 Mobius: I've done that with a mouth full of coffee.. Not good for the keyboard.
17:01 AlphaInvestor: I keep wipes handy to clean off my monitor for such occurances
17:57 dtree: hello gurus
17:57 dtree: need help on configuring scans
17:59 dtree: how can I get alert with stocks that have 3 consecutive 1 minute green candels?
18:01 Up_n_Up: how are you defining green?
18:01 dtree: green close - close > open ? I dont know - guessing
18:02 Up_n_Up: so close higher than open?
18:02 dtree: in that minute yes
18:02 Up_n_Up: sum(close>open,3)==3
18:03 Up_n_Up: that be it.
18:03 Up_n_Up: later folks...
18:04 dtree: do you have a library of scripts I can read
18:05 momo: dtree make sure you select 1 minute aggregation in scan script with that code
18:06 momo: Default is usually D for daily, change that to 1 minute
18:06 dtree: I am compeletely new for this guys - I worked on C# and TSQL
18:07 dtree: basically what i want is - priceline is above VWAP , 20SMA, 50SMA, 200 SMA
18:07 dtree: and when 3 green candlestickes occure I want to get alert
18:08 dtree: please help
18:10 momo: close > VWAP() and close > average(close,20) and close > average(close,50) and close > average(close,200) and sum(close > open,3) == 3
18:11 momo: select 1 minute aggregation in script
18:12 momo: Then you can save scan as watchlist and also create alert on scan
18:13 dtree: would it be possible for you to send me this custome scan? I want to learn from it also , as its going to be the first script for me
18:14 momo: I already wrote it above, copy paste in custom scan
18:15 momo: Call support to guide you through how to use scan feature and they will guide you one on one
18:16 momo: 866-839-1100
18:16 dtree: ok thank you

18:48 dynce1: what is a expected double? trying to clean up my code.
18:52 amalia: Need a if then else I believe.
18:57 MTS1: expected double means a number (double) was expected that was not provided or something else was provided instead.
18:57 Up_n_Up: it's expecting a number,  double precision to be exact, check your syntax
19:02 dynce1: ok thanks

08:03 MTS1: A MarketWatch alert, or what type of alert? If MW,use the built-in wizard to build one; RTM @ http://tlc.thinkorswim.com/center/howToTos/thinkManual/MarketWatch.html
08:05 rcmcfe: An alert on a specific stock...
08:08 dmj: Hi,  does anyone happen to have a script that automatically plots the 1st hr high and low ?  and possibly also the overnight high and low ?
08:11 MTS1: DMJ; Mobius' ORB script can be set to an opening range of 1 h to do that; on his MyTrade.

05:53 chief: Nube..not sure if he was first but I think rp did it with an indicator called "Edge"
06:18 Nube: Thanks, chief! I will look into that.
06:25 Nube: There's an error in the ToS translation of the Stiffness Indicator in the latest issue of TASC mag. It's effectively the same but has the wrong multiplier for scaling. The accompanying strategy mentioned specific levels which are incorrect in the study version shared in the mag. This version corrects that error.

06:42 Paris: Looked through my stash, the only study with "Stop Light" as an embedded string is Mobius Multiple Aggregation EMA Stop Lights, published in May 2018
06:44 Anonymous so far: Is there any documentation on Thinkscript that explains which functions work on the mobile app?
06:45 Nube: Anonymous, no but there are some people here with experience with the mobile app. What question / problem are you having with it?
06:47 Anonymous so far: I have a script which uses addlabel() do display text based on some basic conditions. it works perfectly on desktop platform but nothyis displayed on mobile app
07:07 Nube: Yeah, no string on mobile so label and bubble are no go
07:07 Anonymous so far: oh ok. thanks for clarifying
07:10 Nube: I have used a plot to display that data but it's not nearly as handy as a label or bubble
input labelData = yes;
plot output = if labelData then labelData else indicator;
07:26 crashman: TOS has renko bars?
07:27 crashman: anyone?
07:30 SWPRoth: gm all
07:30 SWPRoth: antone have a link that explains use of Stiffness indicator?
07:32 Mobius: crash.. yes TOS has RENKO bars
07:33 crashman: how do i access?
07:34 Mobius: read the manual
07:34 crashman: can u tell me please. make it easy 4 me
07:34 Mobius: no  not my job
07:35 crashman: what manual?
07:37 Nube: The manual on the platform you have questions about
07:37 crashman: so mean
07:38 Nube: Wait til we start drinking
07:38 crashman: just tell me how to access it renko bar settings
07:38 Nube: no
07:39 JohnnyQuotron: nube...the stop light visualization method that I have been playing with  http://tos.mx/ayq5nc#
07:42 JohnnyQuotron: the Stop Light indicators are likely badly named in the OneNote and can be found under Composite Indicators in the uncategorized section.  sorry
07:43 Nube: The mobile app question reminded me I've not done a Globex High Low for the app
