Cindy Faber TOS: Select one of the custom watchlist columns and replace code in it with this.  Then open option chain and select your new custom column's name as an option chain column. 

IMPORTANT REMINDER: per industry regulation OI is updated only once/day, a few hours after market close. 

 

#HINT: this is a custom watchlist column that can be selected as a column on a watchlist of option symbols and/or as a column on the option chain 

 

plot OI_NetChg = open_interest() - open_interest()[1]; 

OI_NetChg.SetDefaultColor(color.BLACK); 

AssignBackgroundColor(if OI_NetChg > 0 then color.GREEN  

          else if OI_NetChg < 0  

                  then color.RED  

                  else color.GRAY); 

 

Or a more space efficient version: 

 

def OI_NetChg = open_interest() - open_interest()[1]; 

AddLabel(yes, Round(OI_NetChg, 0), color.BLACK); 

AssignBackgroundColor(if OI_NetChg > 0 then color.GREEN  

  else if OI_NetChg < 0                              

          then color.RED  

          else color.GRAY); 

 

here is another way to use one of your custom columns to create an option chain column: 

 

#HINT: this is a custom watchlist column that can be selected as a column on a watchlist of option symbols and/or as a column on the option chain.  It is blank if volume is lower than open_interest allowing it to act as an alert by only appearing when volume is higher than open_interest 

 

def alert = volume > open_interest; 

AddLabel(yes, if alert then "volume vs OI" else ".", color.BLACK); 

AssignBackgroundColor(if alert == 1 then color.RED else color.LIGHT_GRAY);
