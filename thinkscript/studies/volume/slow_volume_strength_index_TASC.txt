THINKORSWIM: AUGUST 2015 TRADERS’ TIPS CODE 

In his June 2015 article “The Slow Volume Strength Index,” 

author Vitali Apirine expands on the slow relative strength 

index (SRSI) concept presented in his April 2015 article, but 

this time, changes the focus to volume. 

Keeping in the same theme as his earlier article that “slow 

and steady wins the race,” he uses ideas from the SRSI concept but this time measures the relative strength of volume. 

We have recreated his slow volume strength index (SVSI) 

as a thinkorswim study using our proprietary scripting language, thinkscript. We have made the loading process extremely easy—simply click on the link http://tos.mx/MEqL2n 

and choose save script to thinkorswim, then choose to rename 

your study to “SlowVSI.” You can adjust the parameters of 

these within the edit studies window to fne-tune your variables. 

In the example shown in Figure 3, you see the SlowVSI 

plotted on a chart of GE over the past year. For a more detailed description of the indicator, please see Apirine’s article 

in June 2015 issue.
