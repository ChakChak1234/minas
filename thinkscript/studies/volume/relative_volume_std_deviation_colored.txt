# Relative Volume Std Dev - Colored By Price 

# LongShort 

# 5.6.2014 

# 

# Modified the TOS RelativeVolumeStdDev study to color histogram by price  

# candle action. This has been configured for 2 standard deviaitions, so  

# those bars were really big volume compared to "normal" 

# 

# While Mobius likes his Volume Percent R study, I like this version 

# which uses standard deviation of volume. It finds unusual volume bars  

# significantly different than the average.  

# 

# The study colors volume bars with "unusual/abnormal volume", greater  

# than 2.0 StdDev away. Relative volume bars that exceed a 2.0 StdDev  

# of volume are colored green or red. If it is less than 2 StdDev (i.e".  

# normal" volume ) they are colored gray 

# 

# Volume = Validation. hence a trend change or big move on a colored bar is  

# significant. A trend change or big move on a gray bar doesn't garner  

# much respect. 

# 

# I use this study for finding volume outliers. It is a volume study used  

# to highlight extreme volume or volume spikes. This study is based on standard  

# deviation of volume being outside the normal distribution, and is similar  

# in concept to Mobius’ Volume %R study. 

# 

# Mobius version is a relative Volume %R study which simply reduces the  

# last 20 bars to a scale of 0 to 100. It tends to nail the volume at swings. 

# 

# I have been using 60 as the default aggregation. It is more sensitive to  

# length because volume picked up after the recent market volatility. This  

# is a change in market dynamics. On a daily chart, set the aggregation to 

# a shorter length, about 25. 

# 

# Signals: 

# Oversold   - you want RelVol above StdDevLevel and RelVol.Color Bullish 

# Overbought - you want RelVol above StdDevLevel and RelVol.Color Bearish 

# 

# While some volume bars may not be very high, the ones that are signals  

# are colored. Volume = Validation. If a move doesn't happen with big volume, 

# are the big institutions really on board with the move? 

# 

# A 2.0 SD above normal volume is considered big volume; you could also use 

# other settings 

# 

# Note that the longer colored bars co-incide with the following 4 scenarios 

# 

# A) the start of the trading session 

# B) the end of the trading session 

# C) big moves 

# D) new lows 

# 

# This study provides useful trading information like for example: 

# 

# What color are the bars at the start of the week on the move down 

# What color are the bars in the middle of the week on the new lows 

# Did we get a bunch of green bars after we hit the new lows (indicating buying support) 

# What color are the bars at the end of the week
