#Theorist Norman Fosback has acknowledged, however, that the NVI has historically been far more effective at predicting bull markets than downward trends.  
# Fosback notes that these odds are not symmetrical. There is a 96% chance of a bull market when NVI is above its 255-day EMA, but only a 53% chance of a bear market when NVI is below its 255-day EMA.
