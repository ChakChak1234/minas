## HAMMOND B3'S "B3_ADXupper" THE UPPER SUBGRAPH VERSION OF "B3_ADX"  

## www.mytrade.com/hammondb3  

##  

## This study is based on several ADX theories by several traders combined.  

## HAMMOND B3 didn't come up with the methodology for the formula,   

## merely combined the logic of several others into one easy to use study.  

##  

## ALL PLOTTING OF LINES AND ADX/DMI VALUES HAVE BEEN REMOVED THOUGH ALL ARROWS STILL BASED ON THE DATA.  

#---  

## DIRECTIONS FOR USE ::  

## 1) LABEL BOXES POPUP AND TELL YOU WHAT TO DO (or think about), THOUGH TWO BOXES PERMANENTLY EXIST  

##        a. A MODE BOX THAT TELLS YOU THE STUDY'S CURRENT DIRECTIONAL BIAS, IF ANY  

##        b. TREND DECAY IS TELLING YOU HOW MUCH THE TREND HAS WEAKEND  

##            (0% = STRONGLY TRENDING & -100% = TREND IS OVER & NO TREND IS POSSIBLE)  

##            (Brighter the Box = Stronger the Trend)  

## 2) BIG ARROWS MEAN THE SAFEST "WITH THE TREND" ENTRIES (DURING LONG/SHORT MODES) (no guarantees)  

## 3) SMALL GRAY ARROWS DURING SCALP MODE FOR WEAK TRENDS OR NO CONFIRMED TREND (riskier but sometimes trend starters)  

## 4) SQUARES MEAN SCALE OR EXIT IF YOU WISH NOT TO BE GREEDY OR DO NOTHING (profit early and often method)  

## 5) MAGENTA TRIANGLES ARE A POINT OF DECISION, CHOOSE:  

##        a. EXIT (AGAIN FOR THE NOT SO GREEDY AND IS THE RISK ADVERSE CHOICE)  

##        b. ADD (TRENDS TEND TO CONTINUE RATHER THAN REVERSE, FOR THE AGGRESSIVE POSSITION BUILDERS)  

##        c. BET AGAINST THE TREND (FOR EARLIEST REVERSAL ENTRY, !ADVANCED TRADERS ONLY!)  

##        d. DO NOTHING (WAIT FOR NEXT EXIT DECISION)  

## 6) BOXES POPUP SOMETIMES GIVING INFORMATION:  

##        a. WHEN DIRECTIONAL DOMINANCE IS CHANGING   

##            (if staying on trend is important, this is an exit if the signal goes against you)  

##        b. WHEN REVERSAL RISK IS HIGH (be cautious as no definite directional dominance exists)  

##        c. DURING DIRECTIONAL BREAKOUT OF THE INDICATOR   

##            (breakout of trend; trade entry if price is also breaking the corresponding new Hi or Lo)  

##        d. WHEN A TREND COMES TO AN END  (yellow dot)  

##          (the risk adverse trader would want to exit here, others begin considering scalp mode)  

## 7) THE 20 BAR EXPONENTIAL MOVING AVERAGE IS USED TO GIVE A POSSIBLE BETTER VALUED ENTRY  

##        BOX APPEARS WHEN THE DOMINANCE OF ONE DIRECTION IS PRESENT BUT PRICE IS ON OPPOSITE SIDE OF EMA (or touching)  

##        (ADVANCED TRADERS WILL WAIT FOR THE TOUCH OF 20ema BEFORE ENTRY, YOU CAN MISS OPPORTUNIES WAITING)  

##        (By this method, enter trade upon popup of 20ema box AFTER & IF the MATCHING red/green arrow LAST signaled)
