# Elders Impulse - Price bars are colored according to these conditions:  

# Green = MACD is greater than previous MACD and EMA is greater than previous EMA.   

# Red = MACD is less than previous MACD and EMA is less than previous EMA.  

# Blue = Neither condition is met. 

# 

# Since MACD is a 4th derivative of price and utilizes EMA's and the second  

# indicator is an EMA this system is Multicolinear and not one that makes a  

# lot of sense to me. 

 

input fastLength = 12; #hint fastLength: MACD fast length 

input slowLength = 26; #hint slowLength: MACD slow length 

input MACDLength = 9;  #hint MACDLength: MACD smoothing length 

input averageType = AverageType.EXPONENTIAL; 

input EMAn = 13;       #hint EMAn: Exponential Moving Average length 

 

def Diff = MACD(fastLength, slowLength, MACDLength, averageType).Diff; 

def EMA = ExpAverage(close, EMAn);
