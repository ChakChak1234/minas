15:14 growex: Hiya everyone. Here's a lil tool to measure volatility..  

  

#VM_StochVol  

#GROWEX  

declare lower;  

input lookback = 50;  

def s1 = fold i = 0 to lookback with n = 0 do  

      n + Power(AbsValue(Log(close[i] / GetValue(close, i)[1])), 2);  

def s2 = fold j = 0 to lookback with k = 0 do  

      k + Log(close[j] / GetValue(close, j)[1]);  

def    sh1 = Sqrt(s1);  

def    sh2 = s2 / Sqrt(lookback - 1);  

plot vols = sh1 - sh2;  

  

  

16:20 AlphaInvestor: looks like it is kinda a standard error (standard deviation of log returns as a proportion of stock price)  

16:21 AlphaInvestor: At least that is this layman's interpretation  

16:29 AlphaInvestor: Actually, that interpretation isn't correct  

16:30 AlphaInvestor: thought it was being divided by sqrt of the log returns, but it is being divided by the sqrt of the lookback
