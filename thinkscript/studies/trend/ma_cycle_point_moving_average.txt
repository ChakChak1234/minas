UPDATE : This script has been rendered inoperable as of 12 Dec 09 due 

to changes in the TOS ZigZag function. I will leave it posted as a 

reference for coders to examine the script methodology. 

 

This very basic script plots a close approximation of the cycle point 

moving average. You enter in the required price reversal for a cycle turn, 

a moving average period, and it does the rest courtesy of the TOS 

zigZag function. I had coded this script some time ago and found nothing 

particularly compelling about it but decided to use it to illustrate 

the only new thinkScript feature I saw in the last build; namely the 

defineColor() command. In the past, when ever I needed to control the 

color of some study plot dynamically, I had to hard code in the colors 

in the associated assignValueColor() statement. As such, the custom 

coloring was only modifiable by altering the thinkScript itself. 

Using the new defineColor() command allows the scripter to code in 

value assignable colors but also allow an end user to change those colors 

should they desire. I expect to retrofit my earlier studies with this 

capability as time allows.
