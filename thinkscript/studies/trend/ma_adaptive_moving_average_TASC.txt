# MovAvgAdaptiveUpdated_TASC 

# We have put together a study for thinkorswim based on the article Adaptive Moving Averages by Vitali Apirine # in the Apr issue of TASC.  http://tos.mx/MYXu1P#  Name it Moving AverageAdaptive_Updated. 

# JQ: the change seems to be in the addition of the mode input

13:57 Paris: UTC, in case you'd like some accompanying notes for that Vitali Apirine study you posted earlier, here's what I have from my notes 

 

The term adaptive moving average is associated with the Kaufman adaptive moving average (KAMA), developed by Perry Kaufman. In this article I will discuss the adaptive moving average (AMA), which is based on the KAMA but has subtle differences. 

 

The AMA is designed to account for the location of the close relative to the high–low range. You’ll find that AMA closely follows prices and can be combined with KAMA to identify turning points and filter price movements. 

 

How’s it calculated? 

 

The values 10, 2, and 30 are the typical settings used with the AMA; however, other values can be substituted depending on your trading style and goals. These settings are similar to KAMA. 

 

10 is the number of periods 

2 is the number of periods for the fastest EMA constant 

30 is the number of periods for the slowest EMA constant.
