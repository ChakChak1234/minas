JQ  Thanks for your great work on the OneNotes library of daily chats. Chats been overflowing lately 

and one can't be checking in hourly. 

For me I tried Big Hand for some time but let it go for whatever reason. Probably the market went 

range bound for while & BH didn't seem any edge?   

Note this early script doesn't exactly stress use on a Weekly (tho I mainly did since lesser times didn't 

seem any advantage, or maybe too misleading, vaguely rem). It just says he compared BH to Weekly PMO. 

Hence implies reco of BH on Weekly, not demanding it.  Experiment at will is my mantra. 

  

early Big Hand.  Likely you have the AI one (s).  This one was from a discussion room elsewhere 

June 18, 2016 my saved date.  It was first time I saw any mention of BH.

# The Big Hand -  Binary 

# Provided to me by Wayne 

#  It is the MACD   19, 39   on the Weekly Chart.  For many years my friend would use the expression "the big hand is pushing up" ,  or  "the big hand is pushing down" ,  so I just went ahead and named it "The Big Hand".   

# Compare it with the Price Momentum Oscillator  20 , 35  on the Weekly Chart,  as well as the 21 EMA and 34 EMA cross on the Weekly Chart.  The signal dates may vary by as much as 4 weeks,  but the end result between the worst and best is less than 1.5% after 20 years,  when using with the SPX.
