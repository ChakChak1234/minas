# Certain comments by Johnny Quotron 

 

 

# 04.21.2018  Johnny Quotron..upon inspection it appears this script is incomplete. 

#    The script identifies divergences only when the MACD histogram is falling and the high is rising 

#    I will do my best to correct this  

#    added wedges to enhance visibility

# MACD Divergence 

# Values in MACD are default values 

# If Price and MACD are Divergent Bar will be colored White 

# Price for the purpose if identifying the Divergence is based on High rather than Close by JQ
