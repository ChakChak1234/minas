 

Std Dev Chnl Scan 

def _sdcU = StandardDevChannel().UpperLine; 
plot scanSDC = close >= _sdcU and close[1] < _sdcu[1]; 


following the same logic the sdcL must be : 

 def _sdcL = StandardDevChannel().LowerLine; 
 plot scanSDC = close <= _sdcL and close[1] > _sdcL[1]; 

 


 

  

Std dev Channel 

 
 I am trying to write a script that will alert when price cross the 
 upper/lower line of the Standard Deviation Channel (SDC). I have used this 
script below successfully with the Ichimoku study: 


 Crosses(Ichimoku().Chikou, Ichimoku()."Span B")[26]  

def SDC_Upper = StandardDevChannel().UpperLine; 
plot scanSDC = close >= SDC_Upper and close[1] < SDC_Upper [1]; 
 
Following the same logic the SDC lower cross is : 

 def SDC_Lower = StandardDevChannel().LowerLine; 
 plot scanSDC = close <= SDC_Lower and close[1] > SDC_Lower [1];
