Market Forcast scan 

The market forecast as a scan 

Not knowing exactly what you want and not knowing your familiarization with the platform, let’s start from the beginning. Here’s a ‘cookbook’ method for finding stocks that have all 3 Market Forecast parameters in either the upper OR lower reversal zone.  

    Open any TOS chart and then click on the ‘Studies’ drop down, then ‘Edit Studies’. That will open the Edit Studies and Strategies window. 

    Click on New in the lower left corner to open a new study window. 

    In the window will be one statement, plot Data = close; Delete that line and paste in the following lines: 

# scan_clusters() == 1 
def c1I = close - lowest(low,31); 
def c2I = highest(high,31) - lowest(low,31); 
def FastK_I = c1I / c2I * 100; 
def c1N = close - lowest(low,3); 
def c2N = highest(high,3) - lowest(low,3); 
def FastK_N = c1N / c2N * 100; 
def Intermediate = Average(FastK_I, 5); 
def NearTerm = Average(FastK_N, 2); 
def Momentum = reference marketforecast.Momentum; 
def ClusterHigh = Intermediate>=80 && NearTerm>=80 && Momentum>=80 ; 
def ClusterLow =  Intermediate<=20 && NearTerm<=20 && Momentum<=20; 

# Bullish Scan 
plot cluster = if clusterhigh then 1 else 0; 

#Bearish Scan 
#plot cluster = if clusterlow then 1 else 0; 

Save this study, I named mine ‘scan_clusters’. You’ll need to name yours the same to get the scan to work. 
(Note: I use the word ‘scan’ in the name to make it easier to find my custom scans) 
    The study will show up on your chart but you don’t want it there, so remove it from the chart. And close the ‘Edit Studies and Strategies’ window. 
    Now go to the Scan tab, then Stock Hacker. In the ‘load scan query’ dropdown select ‘Create New Scan Query’ to get the following window:

    Click on each of the 3 red x’s to delete those parameters. Then click on Add Study Filter. Under ‘Criteria’ you will see ADXCrossover in the selection box. Click on that box (it is a dropdown as well) and select ‘Custom’ at the bottom of that dropdown and you get this window: <image002.jpg> 
Delete the only line of code in the window and paste this into it: scan_clusters() == 1 

You’ll now see this:

 Click OK, name the scan whatever you like and click Save. I named mine Clusters. Then click the ‘Scan’ button. A list of stocks will appear after a short delay. 

    You should now have the scan you want. A note will probably pop up telling you that if you change the study, the change won’t be referenced by the scan. 

    You may get a lot of low volume hits, so you can also sort by volume.  Or if you have a list of stocks in a watchlist, you can also tell the scan to look at only those stocks 

    I’ve set up my TOS platform so that I can ‘link’ the returned stocks to charts that already have the studies that I want applied.  I used green and blue, but you can use whatever you like.  Here’s a list of the stocks returned, sorted by volume.  Now I just click on the color coded link and I see the chart the way I want it.
