S-SCAN RSI UNDER 20 & CLOSE > 200-DAY SMA 
TOC Return 
Alternate 1 
Stocks that have a RSI under 20 for 3 days and a closing price above the 200 SMA 


Plot scan = (RSIWilder(length = 2) < 20 && RSIWilder(length = 2)[1] < 20 && RSIWilder(length = 2)[2] < 20 && Close > SimpleMovingAvg(length = 200)) 

Alternate 2 
stocks that have a 3-day RSI under 20 a closing price above the 200 SMA 


Plot Scan =(RSIWilder(length = 3) < 20 && Close > SimpleMovingAvg(length = 200)) 

Comment: Set agg to day.

# If you'd like to scan for stocks that have crossed the an input level (e.g. 30 level) 
# on the RSI for the first time in 3 years. 
# 
# The scanner limitation is 750 daily bars. It doesn't go any further 
# back than that. TOS limits historical scan data to 730 days for daily 
# and up aggregation, so I'm not sure there's enough to do that accurately. 
# This should get what's available within TOS limits.

RSI dot above price 

 

# Plot a green dot on the price chart when RSILength is above 70 

# Plot a red dot on the price chart when RSILength is below 30 

# write the correct script to add a dot above the bars when : 

RSI above 70 = green dot 

RSI below 30 = red dot
