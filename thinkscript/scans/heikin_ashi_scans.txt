RE: [TOS_thinkscript] Re: Heikin Ashi Candle Charts - Scan for Bullish and Bearish Shift By R. Houser 

 

Actually, I used the calculations for haClose contained on page 55 of Sylvain Vervoort's book, "Capturing Profit with Technical Analysis," 2009, Marketplace Books, Inc. 

 

A careful analysis of TOS Heikin-Ashi bars shows that on their charts they use this formula for calculating haClose, "def xClose = round( ( open + high + low + close ) / 4, 2 );" 

 

If you feel more comfortable using the alternate calculation for the scan, here's the script. 

######### scan ################### 

rec HAopen = compoundValue(1, (HAopen[1] + ohlc4) / 2, ohlc4); 

def HAclose = (HAopen + Max(high, HAopen) + Min(low, HAopen) + ohlc4) / 4; 

def Bullish = if ( HAclose - HAopen ) >= 0 then yes else no; 

plot Scan   = Bullish;

Though the alternate calculation produces a somewhat smoother plot than the accepted formula, used in the scan it returns the same result set as the my original script, the difference is, apparently, not material in practice. 

 

My own philosophy is that given the choice, in scans and such, I'll use 1st) TOS actual values and 2nd) when that's not available I'll use calculations that produce results that match TOS's. In charts, particularly in other's studies, I'll use the calculation of the author as they usually have a reason for deviating from accepted formulae. 

 

#### from Deb Fine quoting R Houser ############# 

In order to construct a scan you have to answer the question, what causes the bars to change color? Actually the color thing is a distraction because the HA bars are a candlestick variant you need to answer the question what causes the bars to change from filled body to hollow body? 

 

Answer: 

The body is filled if haOpen is greater than haClose. The body is hollow if haOpen is less than haClose. 

 

So the challenge boils down to how does one get haOpen and haClose in a scan script? You have to calculate them. Here's a script that will scan for a shift from bearish to bullish; finds 247 stocks as of this moment. 

def xClose  = ( open + high + low + close ) / 4; 

rec xOpen   = compoundValue( 1, ( xOpen[1] + xClose[1] ) / 2, xClose ); 

def Bullish = if ( xClose - xOpen ) >= 0 then yes else no; 

plot Scan   = Bullish; 

 

to scan for a shift from bullish to bearish change the last line: 

def xClose  = ( open + high + low + close ) / 4; 

rec xOpen   = compoundValue( 1, ( xOpen[1] + xClose[1] ) / 2, xClose ); 

def Bullish = if ( xClose - xOpen ) >= 0 then yes else no; 

plot Scan   = !Bullish;

HA Osc Long Term 

 

In his article in this issue, “Long-Term Trading Using Exchange Traded Funds,” author Sylvain Vervoort introduces his heikin-ashi candles oscillator long term (HACOLT). 

 

This system is intended to be implemented on exchange traded funds. Because this security type is generally broad-based in its price drivers, Vervoort recommends a weekly charting approach for the most consistency in this type of application. 

 

We have recreated this study in our proprietary scripting language, thinkScript, for your use. The display output is very straightforward, with a 100 max signal for a positive period, a 50 signal for a neutral period, and a zero for a negative period 

 

HEIKIN-ASHI CANDLES OSCILLATOR LONG TERM (HACOLT). A 100 max signal indicates a positive period, a 50 signals a neutral period, and a zero shows a negative period. 

 

The code for the custom study is shown here along with instructions for applying it to a thinkorswim chart. 

 

From TOS charts, select “Studies” ? “Edit Studies” 

Select the “Studies” tab in the upper left-hand corner 

Select “New” in the lower left-hand corner 

Name the strategy (such as “HACOLT”) 

Click in the script editor window, remove “plot Data = close;” and paste in the following:
