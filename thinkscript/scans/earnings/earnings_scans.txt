Earnings Scan #1 

Jesse: The below is how to scan for earnings 

Input length = 10; 
def a = hasearnings(); 
def b = getday(); 
def c = if a then b else 0; 
def d = average(c, length); 
def e = d[-(length - 1)]; 
plot f = e > 0; 
 

Earnings Scan #2 
Received the following script from Thinkscript support 

declare lower; 
def EstEarning = GetEstimatedEarnings(); 
def ActEarnings = GetActualEarnings(); 
rec ae=if !isnan(ActEarnings) then ActEarnings else ae[1] ; 
rec ee=if !isnan(EstEarning) then EstEarning else ee[1]; 
plot scan=if ae>ee then 1 else 0;
