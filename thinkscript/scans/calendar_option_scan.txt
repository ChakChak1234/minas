Dilbert: Here is my calendar scan.  It is based on one that Mr.  Script wrote that I made a small change to.  It's intent is to find options that would make good front month legs for calendars.  Selection of the back month is up to you.  It finds front month options with higher IV than the back month with the hope that the calendar will benefit from a collapse in IV (front month IV will drop more that the back month).  http://tos.mx/jYhwEV
