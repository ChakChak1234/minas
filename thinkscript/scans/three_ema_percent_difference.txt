#Scan for % difference between three EMA's. 

#Request is to "scan for stocks where percentage difference 

# between 50EMA,100EMA and 200 EMA is less than 1%." 

# The request has many unknowns about specifics, so a completely flexible  

# approach has been coded for one to fit what you want, The 1% stated gets a large number of hits and may need refining to reduce the number of hits.

#======= Scan Usage ======== 

# Use the above conditions in composing your single 'Plot Scan - " line. For example, 

# to scan for the Fast_EMA related to the slo_MA and the med_MA, your scan statement would be 

#plot  Scan =  cond_fast_slo + cond_fast_med; 

# to scan for the Med_EMA related to the slo_MA only, your scan statement would be: 

plot Scan = cond_slo_fast;

14:23 LongShort: StanL - I love the flexibility of the percent difference scan. I took the liberty of making it a little more specific to my needs. Others might also find it useful. This modification looks specifically for one EMA being within xx% of another EMA. Thanks, Longshort aka AlphaInvestor (or AI).
