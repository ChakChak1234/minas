 
IsDoji Gap up/down Scan 

# IsDoji Gap Scan 

input length = 20; # to get average body height 
input bodyFactor = 0.05;  # body height multiplier 

# Only one plot can be active in the scan, so comment in whichever isDojiGap plot required to scan for gap up or gap down. 


## GAP UP 
plot isDojiGap =  low > high[1] and IsDoji(length, bodyFactor); 
 
## GAP DOWN 
#plot isDojiGap =  high < low[1] and IsDoji(length, bodyFactor);
