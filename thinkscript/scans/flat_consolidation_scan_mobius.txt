(Log(Sum(Max(high, close[1]) - Min(low, close[1]), 10) /  

(Highest(high, 10) - Lowest(low, 10))) /  

Log(10)) > .7 

 

 

Mobius: If you want  relatively short term consolidation leave the lengths at 10 and use a daily scan. For a bit more consolidation make lengths 13 and if you want equities that have been in consolidation for a long time use a monthly scan. 

 

You don't want base-10 log if you're looking for linearity.
