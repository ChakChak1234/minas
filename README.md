# Types of indicators

"A perfection of means, and confusion of aims, seems to be our main problem.""   - Einstein

1. Trend

    These technical indicators measure the direction of a trend by comparing prices to an established baseline. Direction but not strength.

    - Moving averages (MA)
    - Parabolic stop and reverse (PSAR): Used to find potential reversals in the market price direction.
    - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): Used to reveal changes in the strength, direction, momentum, and duration of a trend in a stock’s price.

2. Momentum

    These technical indicators may identify the speed of price movement by comparing the current closing price to previous closes. Strength and not direction. 

    - Stochastic Oscillator: Used to predict price turning points by comparing the closing price to its price range.
    - Commodity Channel Index (CCI): An oscillator that helps identify price reversals, price extremes, and trend strength.
    - Relative Strength Index (RSI): Measures recent trading strength, velocity of change in the trend, and magnitude of the move.

3. Volatility

    These technical indicators measure the rate of price movement, regardless of direction.

    - Bollinger bands: Measures the “highness” or “lowness” of price, relative to previous trades.
    - Average True Range: Shows the degree of price volatility.
    - Standard Deviation: Used to measure expected risk and to determine the significance of certain price movements.
    - measures risk rising, or risk dropping

4. volume
    
    These technical indicators measure the strength of a trend based on volume of shares traded.
    
    - Chaikin Oscillator: Monitors the flow of money in and out of the market, which can help determine tops and bottoms.
    - On-Balance Volume (OBV): Attempts to measure level of accumulation or distribution, by comparing volume to price.
    - Volume Rate of Change: Highlights increases in volume. These normally happen mostly at market tops, bottoms, or breakouts.
